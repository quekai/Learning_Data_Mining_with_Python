This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.

Je lui demande si elle a des nouvelles du p\u00e9riodique en musique, elle r\u00e9pond super b\u00eate \"j\\'travaille pas chez Ebsco, j\\'ai fait mon possible, y\\'a plein de p\u00e9rio qui attendent qui sont plus importants\".  J\\'ai r\u00e9pondu \"ok, de toute fa\u00e7on, who cares\".   Elle m\\'envoie des courriels tout correct, auxquels je r\u00e9ponds l\u00e9g\u00e8rement.  Elle me fatigue.

"female"	"'\\n\\nJingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way....   it\\'s Christmas time!!!  I\\'m so excited...well kind of...hubby does not have Christmas eve or Christmas off...BUT I get the 24th through 26th off, yippee!!!  Then, the following week, I have the 1st and 2nd off!!!  Plus, I have a couple half days in there because the sitter isn\\'t working...woohoo!  I have just about all of my shopping done...just a few last minute details, which of course, include hubby.  He finally sat down last night to do a list for me, but it is all out of catalogs!!!  I told him I didn\\'t know if that would work since it is so close, but we\\'ll see...  Still no word from Sam...it is kind of funny actually...do I think she got the hint?  Maybe...I\\'m the queen of no confrontation...so I\\'m hoping I don\\'t have to spell out the fact that I don\\'t see how she can consider herself a friend, let a lone a best friend considering she STEALS and LIES...ugh.  This so takes me back to high school...it is annoying...  Speaking of which...B and I went to H\\'s house this Sunday...this girl is nuts!  Her ex is getting married this coming year, so of course she is trying to get married BEFORE him...psycho.  To top it off, she is telling me all this drama she has in her life...like it is perfectly normal for an almost 30 year old to have so much drama, like she is back in jr high...she kept saying \"now it isn\\'t any of my business, but I said...\"  Hello?!  Did you hear what you just said???  It ISN\\'T any of your business, so stop getting in the middle of every blessed thing...it is so strange that adults still feed off of drama...maybe it was the amount of drama I had in my \"younger\" days (ha!)...I had more than my share and now, I just try to stay out of everything...if someone asks my opinion, well, of course, I have one and I will give it to you, but I try to bite my tongue until someone asks...  anyway...better get back to work...not really...a friend called...lol!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nahhh...another monday morning...I hate Mondays...especially when woken up at 4:30am because your hubby is yelling at your toddler and trying to put your toddler back to sleep in a wet bed.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I love my hubby, but does he ever get it that he is the adult and he allows a four year old to get his goat?  It astounds me...  Anyway...alot going on...not sure where to start...oh, yeah...that computer I got...sucked major dookie...so I\\'m back with my old one...and ever more grateful for it...ha!    House projects: Hubby ripped down ceiling...I decided I wanted authentic tins.  Now, understand, spatial relations is not my thing.  So on eBay (I\\'m addicted, I will admit!) someone was selling tins...32 (12\" each) for $105...cool!  That is cheap!  So I bought them and told the guy I would need enough for a 10x15 room.  Umm...that comes to $600 something!  And, it is closer to $700!!! HOLY SHIT!!!  I am so dead when hubby finds this out...so this month, overtime will be my middle name!!!  Britney:  Got tickets to see the concert...let\\'s see if everyone follows through with paying me!  This is why I hate to be the one buying tickets...I can\\'t stop thinking about it until everyone pays me...ugh...ocd at its finest!  Friend in TX: called me at work...after MONTHS...why, oh why did I have to be at my desk?!  She said she thought I was mad...I said I wasn\\'t, I mean, that isn\\'t a lie...I\\'m not mad, just done.  So she talked at me for a while...as usual.  Supposedly she was in the hospital for 10 days...I just don\\'t believe her anymore...she has presents for me she is sending.  I have to laugh now...I must have sounded like a bitch...I didn\\'t get her anything, and I have no intention to...so I just said, you shouldn\\'t have...oh that is nice...etc...whatever.  So, I finally told her my boss needed to talk to me and hung up...no promise to call but I have a feeling she will never get it, you know?  At least that gives me time to decide if I am just being psycho or if I really should forget about her...  Hubby:  Inmate hung himself in his cell...god, it is awful...b and I had brought him dinner and that is when it happened.  He feels responsible and guilty but he is so confused...I\\'m praying he goes to see a counselor because there is only so much I can say...I don\\'t know what he is going through and he is having a hard time opening up.  I don\\'t think he really believes anything I say anyway...I just feel really bad for him...I hate to see him hurt like this...  Other than that...nothing...ha!  Our house is a disaster with the construction...I am praying by March it will all be done and be a faint nightmare...though, we may end up having to wait on the carpet if I keep spending all this money...I need a self-help group!!!\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nI so hate stereotypes...really...do people realize how much they can hurt?  I have a couple friends that have \"revealed\" to me lately that when they first met me they thought I was a snob and conceeded...so, I asked why.  I know enough from my past that I need answers otherwise I will drive myself crazy as to why...well, supposedly it is because of how quiet I was and the fact that I dress nice...what?!  First off, being quiet is a curse...I\\'m shy.  People don\\'t usually believe me, but it really is true.  Now, once I know you, no, I would not say that I am shy.  Reserved in what I reveal, yes, but shy, no.    Secondly, I dress nice?  What is that?!  At first glance, that may seem like a compliment and maybe it is in an off-color kind of way, but it is not really.  See, why should I be judged on what I wear?  I don\\'t even think I particularly dress nicely.  Obviously, I suffer from self-consciousness so I wouldn\\'t, but really...I know many other people who dress a LOT nicer than I do.  Anyway...plus, if they knew how I bought my clothes...you know those $3 shirts at Target that no one else wants...that\\'s me!  I buy EVERYTHING on sale...literally, the most I have EVER spent on jeans was $30something dollars at the Gap.  The reason I spent that much was because a friend had sent me this awful pair as a present and I was exchanging them...so I could rationalize that it was not really my money I was wasting anyway.  Plus, name brands?  I have a couple...maybe two.  And I think both are name brand shoes!  One pair I just bought a couple months ago with my Christmas money (again, not really my money I\\'m wasting)...I bought some DKNY slip-ons at Marshall\\'s (the TJ Maxx type store) and I think they were $30-35 dollars...so, not a whole lot was spent!  It took me two weeks to finally pull them out of the bag and wear them because I was so horrified I had spent so much on shoes.  Obviously, I have spent money on real tennis shoes but that is because of my bursitis.  The last time I had new tennis shoes was in college so my Nikes have lasted 5 years at least!  My shoe closet is filled with PayLess Shoes...so, yes, I have a ton of shoes but they were bought at PayLess and the majority of THOSE were clearanced!!!  I don\\'t know why this hurts my feelings...I guess because last time I checked I didn\\'t realize it wasn\\'t \"cool\" to look nice and I thought I am supposed to take care of myself.  Oh, yeah...this girl also mentioned that I am always getting my hair done...to which I replied, I have NO idea what you are talking about because the last haircut I got was LAST summer...I have dyed my OWN hair with $7 dye that you too can go to Rite Aid and buy!  Oh, yeah, plus I cut myself some nasty-ass bangs this fall...whatever!  I guess I don\\'t see myself as materialistic...my parents, yeah...that was how they loved us...you are upset about something, here go buy a shirt...but both of these people are saying that this was their first impression of me...again, if materialistic means you want things to look nice, than, yeah, I\\'ll admit to it...but I want things to look nice at a fraction of the cost...what a commercial!    Anyway...lol, my non-materialistic self got my bday present from hubby...it is a .50cttw princess cut anniversary band...but, in my defense, it was bought from eBay so we got a super great price...plus, I think it is every present for this entire year...lol...\\n\\n'"

The hair has been falling out more slowly, the extra hair has been growing not so fast, and the mood swings seem to have evened out.  I should be thankful to be where I am at...it used to be about once a week I would wake up and not be able to motivate myself to get out of bed...literally.  I would lie there absolutely incapable of moving.  It was not good.  There was no rhyme or reason and really nothing that I could pinpoint triggering it to come upon me or to lift...now, of course, I realize it was my hormones and body being so absolutely out of order but back then, I thought it was me and that I was the biggest of all losers...the weight thing hasn't really been helped with the met, but I haven't applied myself either.  The memory thing is still shot to hell but the results I have gotten, I couldn't be happier with...well, here I am again, fighting depression.    Don't get me wrong, I know it could still be the hormones...but it could also be my life.  I mean, after what happened to hubby at work, I was so freaked out and concerned for him...my body can handle like zero stress...my brain literally gets fried, I get exhausted, and I just can't handle it.  It is so strange because I used to be such a stressed out junkie...I lived on stress...now, the new reality is that I can't give a shit about a lot of stuff that I probably should because I will get a headache, get exhausted, or just get physically ill.  Anyway, between hubby's job, my work, etc...things have been stressful for us.    So, yesterday at work, I had a meeting that did not go so well...no particular reason, just one of my peers was laid off and yet we are reassured not to be concerned for our jobs...yeah...also, I have had mad reports to get done that get confusing and so indepth it is hard for me to focus...so after a day of that, I am greeted with my hubby and son, son is sick, hubby is pissed at son, so that sets me off...I try to gently remind hubby he is the adult and he is letting a FOUR year old get the best of him...of course, he gets pissed at me then...so all this is adding up, I get home and have a terrible headache, which turns into a migraine...well, b has awana so I can't take the meds that I can't find anyway...so I take him to church, can't bring myself to go up to the bathroom to search for the meds, so I lay on the couch and konk out...well, I never heard the doorbell and pounding when my dad brought b home, so who knows how long they were out there...got him to bed and then I am wide awake, with a migraine, and now the nausea has set in...so, I stay up for another two hours wishing I could make myself upchuck...I wanted to die, I felt so miserable...finally, I find some flat coke to drink (pop, not drug) force some down my throat and truck it up to bed...thankfully, the headache is GONE today, just the nausea remains.  All this to say...I can't deal with stress...I'm just tired of being physically exhausted.  Thankfully, hubby says a lot less when I tell him I must lay down...but it is still hard.  Until you have dealt with exhaustion, please don't tell me that you know how I feel...I'm wishing for the days where I was just tired...I'm talking about fatigue, exhaustion...as in, I have to motivate myself to move every muscle in my body...even typing this shit is wearing me out...not just mind tired, soul, body, spirit tired...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"\"\\n\\nOkay...I'm having blog issues!  I re-wrote (which I hate!) an entry because it didn't show as published.  When I look at it through blogger, both showed up, so I deleted the one that was a re-write.  But when I type in my actually address neither show up!  Then I click on current posts and they both show up!  This is the point at which I wish I knew what I was doing...I'm so lost!\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nI\\'m so bored...I hate being bored...but at least I\\'m getting paid to be bored...right???  I don\\'t know...BUT since I have nothing better to do and I\\'ve visited most of my regular online haunts, I decided to start reading the \"most recently updated\" blogs...some of that is SCARY but some of it is really cool!  The funny thing is, I hate responding to people\\'s blogs...I feel like I\\'m infringing, even though I have been wanting to get comments up so I can know if someone is reading mine.  Psycho.  But someone had a halarious posting about people who talk during movies/tv...that is SO me!  Hubby and I fight all the time about this because he will ask me what just happened, then again, and again because he keeps asking me to explain, therefore missing even more...just SHUT UP until commercial!  Plus, keep in mind that because I think I\\'m going deaf I am usually watching (movies) with the subtitles at the bottom...I can\\'t read the subtitles and explain to you at the same time!!!  Anyway, I responded and told her I was so with her...  Blogger...why can\\'t I ever be on \"most recently updated\" blog list?  I think this is soon going to become an obsession of mine...I like to see my name in lights, I must admit...ohhh, I\\'m mad now...I forgot to tell Lis how dorky her older sis really is!  See, I am a rw/rr junky...and I had to report an Abe sighting to my rr/rw site...http://www.therealworldroad.cjb.net/  Well, they thanked me on their website but now I can\\'t get past their most recent bloggings to find what the date was.  It must have been sometime this month, last month at the latest.  If you find out the date, let me know...  So, I mentioned Britney to K.  She laughed and told me she would check her calendar.  Which basically means, do I have to?  I\\'m not letting her off that easy!  I\\'ll bring it up to her later this week and see what she says...I just want to get rid of my ticket!\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nI\\'m so glad that worked!  Anyway...so sis can\\'t make it to the Britney Spears concert...my other friend who is going with us had bugged and begged for her ticket, so when Lis couldn\\'t make it, I told her she could buy it...well, now she is backtracking and saying she \"doesn\\'t know\" if she wants it or not...ummm, the concert is in two weeks!  I think I\\'m just being bitchy but I kinda need to know so I can figure out who else to sell it to!  Thing is, until I have it unloaded on someone else, I am going to sit here and worry about it...I\\'m so weird when it comes to this kind of stuff...ocd.  So, I called her today to \"talk\" hoping she would mention if she wanted it or not...she didn\\'t.  Well, i\\'m going out to lunch with a potential buyer, so I am just going to ask her if she wants to go with me...if she does, awesome!  If not, keeping my fingers crossed Red will...but if she wants to go and Red decides she wants the ticket...fuck me...but I\\'m not going to get screwed with an extra ticket because she can\\'t make up her mind...see???  Obsessive...I\\'m trying to rationalize and figure this all out and it is driving me nuts!  The bigger question is...why does a 27year old feel the need to go to this concert anyways?  LOL...\\n\\n'"

"female"	"\"\\n\\nHA!  I love it when can actually get some stuff to work!  Of course, it isn't really my mind figuring stuff out, just my fingers typing in the right questions and finding it...I FINALLY have comments...I have been blogging for 2+ years and JUST found it!  Yippee!  So, leave a comment...or two!  Hubby thought he was in hell this weekend...I made him help me clean out all the closets.  It feels like a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders because they are all (okay, one is left) organized.  I know, I need help.  I don't quite know why I have this insane need for complete organization in hidden places...most people think if there is a door to close on it, who cares?  Not me...it is like this unrelenting thought that I have constantly telling me that my closets are in disarray...no more!  Well, it will last at least a month...  Other than that...it was 70 outside yesterday!  Unbelievable...so B and I went outside for a few hours.  I got to clean out the gardens and revel in the fact that the plants survived and are starting to come out.  Friday B and I went outside and had a mini celebration over our first flower of the season, a crocus.  It was so small but so proud, the overachiever of the bunch.  Of course, I got B to get ecstatic with me...hubby thinks I am nuts and passing it down to B...ha!  Purplepanda is gone...it is so weird, we are so off and on with contact...but of all my sisters, she is the one most like me...I miss her, just knowing she isn't 20minutes away...but, alas, she will be traveling the country getting paid for it!  I envy her and I hope she is able to enjoy it...she deserves to have a fulfilling life and I hope this gives her it...\\n\\n\""

Anyway...still no change here...haven't heard from the inlaws, supposedly hubby intends to call them this weekend...I feel myself getting sick!  We will see how it goes but he keeps telling me I need to prepare myself that nothing is going to be resolved.

"female"	"'\\n\\nlordy...when it rains it pours...I have not slept through the night since Thursday and my colon is kicking into high gear.  It is really quite frustrating and I am trying to keep light hearted about all of this, but I just seem to be getting more and more stressed.  To top it off, my internet is not working quite right today, it is taking FOREVER for pages to load and sometimes they just don\\'t...ugh.  Anyway...let\\'s see if my tired mind can recount the important highlights of the reception...first, we arrive 20minutes late thinking my parents will be there by then and I won\\'t be forced to mingle...wrong-o.  Not there, hubby has to use the bathroom, I\\'m there trying not to vomit so I run into the bathroom.  I\\'m half tempted to call Sam but realize that is nuts so I am trying to use positive self-talk as I\\'m staring at myself in the mirror while washing my hands.  Ummm, wouldn\\'t you know I start breaking into hives around the base of my neck!  Unbelievable.  Old \"friend\" Keri...got engaged, her fiance is almost 10years older than her and works at HCA.  Doesn\\'t make enough money to cover bills so he has to work a second job on the weekend...her stone is so tiny it isn\\'t worth having and she is visibly uncomfortable because she keeps folding her hand under her arms...she is only having a cake reception.  As Sam said, if she is having so many people, the least she could do for all the presents she will be getting is throw people a pig-in-a-blanket...ha!  BTW...I\\'m tired of using initials...  Abe...he and I make eye contact...he smiles, I look away...  My parents get there, they immediately start mingling with the enemy...hubby and I go check out the wedding pictures.  My parents pick a table right next to the enemy!  My parents have to leave because my mom has work to do...hubby and I relocate to the other side of the table because I have been facing the wall the whole time...Jim comes up to talk to us (goes on and on about how many girls he has swarming to date him...yeah, whatever).  Gives me a hard time about the nose ring and church...both of which I make obvious are not up for discussion with him and I couldn\\'t give a rat\\'s ass what he thinks...meanwhile, Abe comes up to sit down with us (oh, I forgot, Jim told me Missy has a baby) and Jim immediately has to get up to go attend to something else...I would have laughed except now I\\'m stuck with him!  Hubby goes up to get cake...Abe starts small talking and mentions how much he likes the nose ring and thinks it\\'s cool...I roll my eyes as I am used to people just saying that...he says, no really...I think it is sexy when girls have their noses pierced...actually, you should watch out because I have a thing for girls with their noses pierced.  To which, I look dead in his eyes with a straight face, you do realize that was my husband that just went up to get cake.  he says, oh I\\'m just kidding...yeah, whatever, don\\'t flirt with me.  So, he and I are talking about his house and his wife comes up...Scott comes back with cake and Abe\\'s wife makes a big deal about it being chocolate (oh, yeah, both she and Abe got TWO pieces, for themselves!  WT) and my hubby, being gracious, offers to switch with her...after this whole fiasco, Abe says, have you been introduced? He introduces me as Sara Barto, to which I say, actually Sara H and then Scott.  Never tells us her name (of course, I know who she is!) so I say, I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name...ha!  I\\'m just being bitchy...Corey Nichols.  Anyway, hubby tells me after we leave that I must intimidate Abe.  All during our short little conversation he was totally downplaying everything.  His house (it\\'s just a house) and his job (it pays the bills, it isn\\'t anything big)...etc...never mentions they are pregnant and of course I don\\'t let on that I know...I can\\'t say that I didn\\'t enjoy this...like Sam said, it was very therapeutic to know that even if I\\'m living in a cardboard box I have more class than all of them put together.  Corey...so NOT attractive...as hubby put it...from far away she looks attractive...up close, bad news!  She has facial scarring (acne?) and has this dorky haircut that is a  bad  old school Deborah Barrone.  Bad fashion sense, bad makeup application skills...the whole package is just wrong.  Again, her rock was too small to be worth having.  Plus, her and Abe have these really ugly sterling silver engraved rings.  The only thing I could think of was that they are the Hebrew engraved \"I am my beloved\\'s and my beloved is mine\" rings...  All in all, it was therapeutic to go...why should these people be able to make me feel small again?  I have gone beyond the tangled in-bred web they all spin together...I escaped years ago...it will be interesting to go to Keri\\'s wedding (if we are invited)...  Didn\\'t get to say more than hi and congratulations to Tom...oh well, I tried...  Sam called today and told me she is pregnant...this is weird.  She told me at the end of the summer that she and Mustafah would start trying later this year...but today she told me they never have used bc.  Whatever, I don\\'t give a shit anymore, lie, don\\'t lie...I\\'m too stressed out to even have a reaction, which is probably a good thing!  oh, yeah...Britney got cancelled...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nwhat a fucking weekend...I\\'m so tired of talking about it but feel I like I should rehash this to have it for memory sake...it\\'s beautiful, who would want to forget?  RIIIIIGHT....  Anyway...the inlaws refused to return hubby\\'s calls on Friday, so basically he and I got no sleep and I was sick all night.  Saturday morning both of us were looking and feeling like HELL...so I asked him to please just call again and try to get it over with...so, as he is trying to dial through our calling card, the phone beeps and it is his mom.  Let me preface this by saying, for quite a few months, hubby has wanted me to seriously go get my hearing checked...so we feel like I could be starting to lose my hearing...I was across the kitchen and could hear her sobbing and yelling at Scott...I really can\\'t remember how it exactly went but the gist was: you should have called Sara was out of line to do so AND if I said such a comment, you should have known that I didn\\'t say it to hurt you...so, is that supposed to release you from the responsibility of your words?  I DON\"T THINK SO!  Hubby explained to her we had decided as a couple to have me call and we do not think there is anything wrong.  Blah, blah, blah...she wasn\\'t listening and she didn\\'t really care.  All she wanted was for him to concede with her opinions, but he didn\\'t so she hung up on him...yeah, I know, but she really is older than jr high!  He and I talked for about 3hours...it basically boils down to, I have been right for the last five years, they don\\'t want a relationship with me, I\\'m merely unfortunate baggage that comes with my hubby and son.  I\\'m done, no more mentioning we should go up there, no more bringing up that they should be invited to come down...I will put out as much effort as you do, which is none.  All of sudden my calendar is wide open!  What a weight gone from my shoulders...  Anyway...he talked to bil on Saturday night (no, parents never called back!) and told him...the thing that makes me most upset is that people are so concerned with getting right with mom and checking on her hurt feelings (for something she has done) that they haven\\'t stopped to think about how my wife is feeling...she hasn\\'t slept all weekend, she is physically ill, and she is crushed that they are basically telling her they don\\'t want a relationship with her...  No resolution...my bil went and talked to them yesterday about it, they stand firm on their ground I shouldn\\'t have called it should have come from hubby...hubby will call some time this week but he isn\\'t in a rush to do it...they will have to agree to disagree there is not other solution.  I will be very proud if he actually tells him what he told his brother...I\\'m so proud he has taken his balls back from his mom...  more to tell...I have the whole reception story to recount...but I need to go pick up my car...$530 for brakes and a rotor...ugh!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nrats...I was trying to take a break from this to read email...I hate spam!  So, basically, I relayed this all to hubby.  He got home extremely late and I was starting to panic that she had called him first...you see, there were times in the past where, when faced with choosing sides, I was on the losing end.  Basically, four years of our marriage was that way...so, I\\'m a little paranoid when it comes to that.  No, she hadn\\'t called, he was just busy at work.  I relayed to him how I felt.  My feelings are really hurt that she refuses to talk to me about this and that she basically told me I am blowing this out of proportion.  I also told him that she tried to manipulate me with tears.  He completely disagrees.  I tried to explain that women use this technique all the time.  If someone can turn them on and then turn them right back off, that is a pretty clear indication they are trying to manipulate you.  I think we agreed to disagree because I think he thinks I\\'m nuts.  Oh, yeah...I forgot the other part.  The day I had this conversation?  THURSDAY.  Which means hubby was going to be at home the next night...duh!  I\\'m  so tired of parts of my brain not participating in group activities!  Therefore, because I left a lot of room open to confuse my mil, hubby would now have to be the one to call...doh!  Anyway...everything peachy?  Not really...my spastic colon is in full force..I have spent the better part of the last 48 hours in a bathroom...Thursday night I think I got a total of 1 1/2 hours of sleep...all I can think about it the fact this is all going to be blamed on me...  So, enter Friday morning...hubby gets a call from his brother.  Wondering what happened and what the conversation was...I think.  See, by this time, hubby has become very elusive with me.  He won\\'t really answer questions and won\\'t give a rundown of what is being said.  The basics he told me...brother says this is not the comment that was made the comment was more \"They were in a different financial situation than you are, if you would prefer to have something else, let us know.\"  Which, at first, holy crap!  That changes things...but as my good friend Kate pointed out, it is still the same thing.  Yup, you\\'re right it is...it sounds more pc but its the same...just wrapped prettier...bil also said that fil had called him in the morning to ask him what scott\\'s mental and emotional well-being had been last time they talked and that I had called and chewed my mil\\'s ass.  He also said that he had had a long chat with M and that we should not read much into what she says because she is pregnant.    There are SOOOO many issues I have with this...did I miss the part where being pregnant effects your brain and mouth?  Don\\'t give me that bs...I was once pregnant too!  To which hubby says, I don\\'t remember you being like that before you were pregnant but you were like that after...yup, you are right...and if you wouldn\\'t have interrupted me, that is EXACTLY what I was going to say...but through it all?  I knew what I was saying and I didn\\'t blow things out of proportion and blame it on pregnancy!  (Side note...we now know the reason I was so emotionally unstable after b was due to my PCOS...which they are JUST NOW taking care of...so back off...)  Also, and the biggest one...I CHEWED HER ASS????!!!!  Trust me, if you are about to get your ass chewed by me, you will know it when I am done that this is what just happened...NEVER did I raise my voice.  But, when I mentioned this to my mom, she had a good point...mil lies and manipulates, we know this just from the conversation the previous night...so what would stop her from lying and manipulating the ears she is bending?  And, since B was in bed and I was alone, it is my word against hers and we all know who\\'s the loser in that situation.  Hubby claims bil never shed his opinion on the whole matter...he didn\\'t say who\\'s side he is taking...okay, but at the same time, he is sayiing it is my fault that I took to heart what M said, I should have known better...so isn\\'t that saying he thinks I\\'m at fault for this?  Add to that his comment to hubby that he thinks mil is abusing her drugs and that plays a part...okay, so everyone else has an excuse and the one left standing without the excuse is the loser?  Wow...everything really can be pointed back to me.  I tried to explain to hubby...this woman had a chance to explain.  I point blank asked her twice what exactly the comment was but she chose not to answer.  RIGHT THERE she shows that she does not deem me good enough to carry on conversation or relationship...obviously, she knew then this was not the comment she made, why didn\\'t she tell me what she had said?  IT WOULD HAVE ENDED THE CONVERSATION.  You know why I think?  Because I think SHE knows that what she meant is what I was told she said...I think she knows that the real comment she made IS the same thing and it is the same thing because she MEANT it as such.    I am not going to try to make excuses...you are an adult, own up to your comment.  Do I need to make an excuse for being hurt by you?  Last time I checked, it is the person\\'s responsibility who does the hurting, not vice versa.  If the comment wasn\\'t made, sure, that changes the hurt associated with the comment...but after our conversation, there is new hurt...hurt that you have confirmed what the last five years have been about...you don\\'t like me, you don\\'t want a relationship with me, and you wish I would just go away.  I\\'m so sick...I\\'m trying to figure out what went wrong...what did I do wrong that caused this woman to hate me so much?  If I can accept you and try to love you because of who you are to the two most important people in my life...why can\\'t you?  I really feel like running away and not leaving a forwarding address.  I asked my hubby what his stand is on this and what Jason\\'s stand is...he said it doesn\\'t really matter what either of their opinions are...like hell!  I have put up with five years of your family thinking the worst of me...five years of their manipulations, hurtful digs, and their obvious dislike of me...WHY would I care what they think?  I know what they think...you are the only person out of this whole mess that I care about...it is ONLY important to me that you believe what I am saying.  \"Well, you\\'re the one I have to live with, of course, I\\'m going to believe you...\"  Well, that doesn\\'t sound good to me...believe me because you believe me, not because you HAVE to live with me.  If you don\\'t believe me, I would rather know that...I don\\'t want you throwing misguided belief.  YOU KNOW ME...are you telling me you really think after five years of hell with your mother I took this opportunity to give her the smack down?  I am so different than I used to be, maybe a year ago, I would have...but not now.  What the hell would that solve?  So, apparently, you don\\'t know me as well as you should either...you too think the worst of me but aren\\'t going to admit that to your family because that is your duty as my husband...  So, all of yesterday, he tried to get ahold of them and couldn\\'t...do I think this was on purpose?  Probably.  I want to talk to dad, I want to talk to bil...I want to simply tell them, look, Scott and I reacted to what we were told...I was trying to clear up what happened.  I would hope you would realize that I tried to use the utmost respect and never was there a point where I yelled at her.    It probably won\\'t happen...hubby expects fil to call and yell...why?  I was an adult...I didn\\'t yell...you are an adult, you deserve the respect of not being yelled at...  gotta go...about to be sick...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nokay...I\\'m back...  I call sil back.  Hubby and i both agree, there is a possibility that mil never made this comment.  Let\\'s give sil one more chance to back away from what she told me before I call mil.  Nope, she said she understood why we wanted to talk to her and it was okay with her.  I apologized if this would get her in trouble but M NEVER changed what the comment was or put a new spin on it.  so, I prepare to make the call...  my fil answers the phone...I small talk with him for no more than five minutes and ask for mom.  She gets on the phone and I ask her if she has a few minutes.  She says sure.  I say \"I\\'m calling because we were informed of a comment you made.  We were told you are telling people the reason you buy us gifts is because we cannot afford them.\"  MIL\"I don\\'t know what you are talking about.\"  Okay, so my tactic of being elusive is not going to work.  I did not want to come right out and say who said what but it was appearing as though I had no choice.    \"Mom, I was told that you are telling people the reason you and dad bought us the crib was because we couldn\\'t afford to buy it.\" \"I don\\'t think I said that.\" \"So, you don\\'t think you told people you bought us the crib because we couldn\\'t afford it?\" \"I don\\'t think I said it like THAT.\" \"How might it have been said then?\" LOOOOONG PAUSE \"Mom?  What do you think was said then?\" \"Did Gary tell you this?\" \"No, Gary did not tell us this...\" \"It must have been Jason then\" \"Mom, it doesn\\'t matter who told us...\" \"Even if I did say it like that, what does it matter?  That was four years ago.\" \"Mom, do you understand why we would be hurt by a comment like this?\" LOOONG PAUSE \"Mom, do you understand that it is Scott\\'s privilige and responsibility to take care of this family?...and you are basically telling people that he cannot fulfill this responsibility.\" LOOONG PAUSE \"I think this is being blown out of proportion.\" \"So, you are saying you can\\'t understand why we might be upset about this?\" nothing...long pause....lasting probably 5minutes...the pause had gotten so long, I turned around to look at the clock and it was an additional 3 minutes... \"Mom?\" \"What?\" \"You can\\'t understand why Scott would be upset about this?\" Enter sniveling...\"so you don\\'t want me to buy brennan anything anymore?\"   Okay...side note...I am trying to recreate but cannot EXACTLY remember the sequence of everything being said...this is a RECREATION.  Please note, already, I have explained to her we appreciate everything she and dad have done for the family.   \"No, mom, that isn\\'t what I\\'m saying.  We understand buying things is a normal \"grandparent\" behavior.  But when you tell people you are buying us things because we cannot afford it, that changes the motivation behind giving and, yes, that would change our view.  We feel like you are telling people we are taking handouts which is not, nor has it ever been the case.  We thought you bought us the crib because you wanted to.  And if you felt like you had to, let me reassure you, we did not then and we don\\'t now, need handouts.  We are okay...we were okay then, we are okay now, and we will continue being okay.\" \"You guys didn\\'t have a lot of money back then...we wanted to buy that for B because he was our first grandson.\" \"I admit things were tight then, mom, but it never came to a point where we needed to ask anybody to hand us anything.  We have always thought the reason you bought us the crib was because you wanted to.\"   LOOOOOOONG pauses taking place...really, it wasn\\'t very often that she would actually answer my question, she usually made me repeat the question before she would acknowledge it....   \"I don\\'t understand what the big deal is...I don\\'t thin this is coming from Scott.\" \"Mom, do you think I am blowing this out of proportion?\" \"I didn\\'t raise my son to think like this.\" \"Mom, do you think I am making this up?  The reason I am calling is because Scott is very busy at work.  If you think that he doesn\\'t feel this way as well, please feel free to call him.  Tonight is probably not a good time but I am sure he is more than willing to discuss this with you.\" \"I did not raise my son to think of his mother like this.\" \"Mom, this does not change our opinion of you.  We still love you.  Scott and I had a long conversation before I called you.  Let me assure you, we are a unit, we both feel the same way.\" \"This is just being blown way out of proportion.\" \"I don\\'t know how to explain it to you any differently.  Maybe ask dad how he would feel.  You have to understand that a man\\'s pride is wrapped up in how well he provides for his family.  I think we can all agree, Scott does a wonderful job doing this and busts his ass to do so.\"   okay...I had made this comment previously...I also made mention of the fact that both he and I had made a lot of sacrifices to be where we are at...and it was hurtful for someone to belittle that by making such a comment.  I also, at some point, mentioned that just because they handle their finances differently than we handle ours does not make their way right and our way wrong.  It makes their way right for their family and our way right for ours.     \"We HAD to accept things from dad\\'s parents.  We were broke and there were many times they gave us money or groceries to help us survive.  There is nothing wrong with that!  We were very thankful for that and knew we wouldn\\'t have gotten by without them!  There were a lot of times they would hand us a $100 bill so we could buy food or gifts for Christmas.\" \"Okay, you\\'re right, but that is different.  There has never been a point where we needed that.\" \"this is being blown out of proportion.\" \"Again, mom.  Are you saying you think I am blowing this out of proportion?\"   To which she goes off on a tangent...for the life of me, I wish I could remember what it was.  All I could think about was the fact she hadn\\'t answered my question and this was probably a pretty important question to have answered.   \"Mom, you still didn\\'t answer my question.  Do you think I am the one who is blowing this out of proportion?\" \"I don\\'t know.\"   Well, I think I do know...anyone I know would read this as a YES.   \"I am just going to wait and talk to Scott about this.\" \"Okay mom, that is fine.  But is there a reason you can\\'t finish talking to me about it?\" \"I just want to talk to Scott.\" \"I hope you know you are free to say anything to me that you need to say to him.\" \"I\\'ll just talk to Scott, tell him to call me tomorrow after I get out of work.\" \"Scott knows what I was going to be saying, mom.  If you need to talk to him, why don\\'t you give him a call at work tomorrow.\" \"Fine.\" \"I\\'ll tell him to expect your call.\" LOOOONG Pause \"I really wasn\\'t expecting there not to be resolution to this tonight, mom.\" Nothing \"You are the mother of my husband, the grandmother of my son.  We are going to be in each other\\'s lives a very long time.  We need to learn how to resolve conflict with each other.  ~pause~  That\\'s what people in relationships do.\" \"Just have Scott call me.\" \"I think you should call him.  He has been pretty busy at work and it would probably be better if you called him.\" \"Fine.\" \"I hope in the future you will be willing to talk and resolve conflict with me.\" \"Okay, bye\" \"Bye\"   I don\\'t really remember if this is truly the point at which I made the comment about mother of husband, etc...also, throughout the whole conversation, I thought I handled myself spectacularly!  No yelling, no name calling.  I had successfully channeled the calm cool lawyer act.  However, the one flaw I find is that I allowed her to get my goat about having hubby call her.  Why?  I\\'m not sure.  Probably because I was so extremely hurt and upset that she refused to have a real conversation with me.  It was unnerving with all of her dramatic pauses and offensive that she wouldn\\'t answer me.  We spent probably 30-45 minutes on the phone and maybe 10-15 of it actually talking (maybe 20).  Add on top of that, she basically accused me of blowing this out of proportion and making this up...how hurtful is that?  For five years you have given me hell...my hubby has been defending YOU telling me it is all in MY head.  For five years, I have been trying to convince myself of that and you just confirmed every demon in my head....you don\\'t like me, you don\\'t want to like me.  So, of the whole conversation, one bad choice.  I wasn\\'t disrespectful, but it was definitely a pissing match.\\n\\n'"
