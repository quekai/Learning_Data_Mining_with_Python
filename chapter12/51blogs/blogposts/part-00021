This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something.

"female"	"\"\\n\\nI feel so icky...do veggie-dogs go bad???  I have had some in the freezer for FOREVER...well, last night, I needed something hot to eat.  I don't know how people do the microbiotic diet.  I just get to a point where, even if I am really not, I need to FEEL like I am eating a real meal.  It HAS to be hot...or at least have been cooked and been hot at some point before I eat it...  Anyway, a couple nights ago, I decided to have a veggie-dog.  So, I took them out of the freezer to let them thaw from the freezer burn...well, I ended up running and it was so dang hot that the last thing I wanted to do was eat.  So, I just threw them in the fridge.  Last night, I wanted a hot meal so bad...add on top of that, I was starving because I had only had a muffin and a bowl of cereal...so, I am scrounging looking for something to be hot and quick but not blow my caloric intake...enter veggie-dogs.  So, I ate BOTH of them on 100 calorie buns.  Not bad in the diet department.  However, this morning I feel like crap!  I got up with a stomach ache which is now just nausea...I am SUCH a baby when it comes to that...I hate the thought of regurgitating...I will hold off as long as possible.  Right now, it is coming in waves...lordy!  Please let this day go by fast!!!  On an up-note...we meet with the ENT today.  I will be interested to hear why the PA thought B needs his adenoids removed.  I am praying overtime there is another approach...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nOHMIGOSH!!!  We have just gotten the best news in a LOOOOONG time!  Hubby has been planning to go to school in the fall to become recertified.  The police academy lasts two semesters so we have been AGONIZING over what to do...do I keep working?  does B go to daycare full time?  do I quit and stay home?  We had yet to come to a decision because we have been going round and round...  Well, yesterday, hubby had an appointment with the director of the program.  She mentioned he needed to call the MCOLES department.  She thought the certification requirements had been changed and since he was already certified once, he possibly would not have to go through the academy again.  Well, needless to say, he was so excited and hopeful but I tried to stay calm because we both figured, with our luck, it wouldn\\'t go that way...  So, he tried to get ahold of someone at MCOLES but the woman he needed to talk to was not available.  He spoke to a guy there who agreed that he did not think he would need to go back through the academy...  So, today, the woman calls and tells him he is good to go!  He needs to pass the physical test and then he will need to attend an 8 day training class.  After that, he will need to take the state certification test and then he will be recertified!  I CANNOT BELIEVE IT!!!  We are both so ecstatic!  I guess after 9/11, the state had to take a look at the requirements and decided if someone had gone through an academy and been certified previously, they should not have to go through an academy again, just the \"refresher\".  Words cannot even describe what a huge relief this is and what a burden of stress has been lifted off both our shoulders...  I am so happy and excited for him...he wants to try to go to the training in August.  It will require some serious dedication and hammering done on his part but I think it is doable.  If he doesn\\'t get his stuff done by August than there will be another one in October.  I told him I\\'m nervous because that means he could be on the road by the end of the year but I know how happy it will make him...keep your fingers crossed!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nyes, I am done freaking out...the PA called back today...I told her we would prefer to see the dr, to which she said, fine but she isn't available until middle to late July.  Fine, no rush.  Well, when I called to make an appointment with the dr, we got an appointment for this FRIDAY!  I am so not impressed with this chickie...but we do like the dr so hopefully she got a clue and won't be calling back!  Other than that...not much new.  It was so freakin' hot last night!  I have this weird thing about trying not to turn on the air until July but I broke.  I was laying on the couch resting and trying to convince myself to go downstairs and run...well, just laying there, I was dripping sweat, I HATE to sweat!  So, I went down for a run and was filling a small pool with my sweat...so, when i came back upstairs I turned on the air.  I am so bad about remembering the cover!  It took me an hour to remember...I realized the air was not pumping in cold air and then it dawned on me...duh!    So, when I put B to bed I told him to just sleep in his undies since it was still so hot upstairs (over 90 degrees!!!)...he says, can I just sleep in my butt...I burst out laughing!  It was so halariously cute!  So the air is on and I am B-less tonight...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nokay...I\\'m officially freaking!  B had his allergist appointment last Thursday, it turned up negative for any allergies.  So, yesterday, I called the ENT doctor to see if she had seen his CAT scan and what conclusions, if any, she had come to since he has no allergies.  Well, the bastards called back at work when I had left our home phone (I had to leave early yesterday, which I knew!) and left me a message that we need to schedule a PRE-OP appointment...as in PRE-OPERATION!!!  So nice of this frickin\\' PA to leave a message telling me my son\\'s adenoids need to come out!  So, now, I have to wait until later this morning to call them back and try to talk to them about it...quite frankly, I want a second opinion...I am not inclined to take your word for it when I have only met you once and this is my only child we are talking about!  And, actually, the PA wants to meet with us, not the Dr...oh, I\\'m sorry, the dr is too busy to meet with us unless she is OPERATING on my four year old?!  Okay...I know, I\\'m being a bit irrational but I hate dr\\'s and I just think this situation could have been handled a lot better...ie, \"Hi, returning your call, we have some conclusions we would like to discuss, please call us back at your earliest convenience!\"\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nman, I hate Monday mornings...I don\\'t know why because there is no one here to bug me...I think it is just the thought that, had it still been the weekend, I would not be here...but since it is Monday morning, I am sitting at my desk procrastinating at 7am!  Well, our weekend was good...the Greek Festival on Friday and T&J on Saturday.  I forget how much I miss T until I spend time with her...she has got to be the one girl that I could guarantee I will always be friends with.  She knows me so well and she is not into the petty/catty bs other girlfriends are into...needless to say, I hated it when they had to leave.  And K is such a little gem!  She was cracking me up even though she barely said anything!  She is a strange mixture of complete girly and tomboy...it is funny to watch...Sunday we went to see grandma.  Well, I hate to say it but she drives me nutso sometimes.  I know it is terrible...I know...but she lays on these massive guilt trips.  I just want to scream, do you understand I work???  It is major frustration and add to that the fact she is losing her mind and she was telling these crazy stories about B and others about my dad.  I feel bad but I just didn\\'t have patience for it yesterday...before everyone here slays me, I am consciously going to try to see her more often and I do love her very much...  On a more not upbeat note...I have had two very deep conversations with both of my younger sisters.  The first was on Thursday night...B and I went to my parents to drop off some baby paraphenalia for my older sis.  They were going to see her NY and I wanted to send some bigger stuff with them so I wouldn\\'t have to ship it.  Well, L and I got talking...her opening line???  Have you ever tried ecstacy?  After I lifted my jaw off the table, I said, no...the one thing I have never tried would be drugs.  Well, this loser of a guy she is \"dating\" (mind you, she says HE told her they were dating) wants to give her some for her birthday.  Supposedly, she told him no but he is insisting.  She said she doesn\\'t know what to do because she doesn\\'t want him to get mad because he spent so much money on it... EXCUSE ME?!?!  So, I just busted out the, have you had sex before?  To which she said, yes...are you currently?  No...I couldn\\'t get too much out of her...no condom, no birth control...but I couldn\\'t get much else out, she said it really wasn\\'t her choice that they didn\\'t use a condom...again, what?!?!  I asked her if she was telling me she was raped...she said no...were you conscious? Yes...were you trashed?  I don\\'t remember what she said...she said it was a one time deal and she has been beating herself up about it.  Lordy...there was so much I needed to say to this girl...considering my parents were lurking, I knew my time was limited...so I started...you need to wear a condom, not only will it protect you from pregnancy but it will also protect you from most other std\\'s that you SURELY do not want, not excluding AIDs...drugs, I understand people do them, I understand people think they are okay...knowing MANY people who have done a variety of things, I don\\'t buy it...God only gives you so many brain cells and why waste them...not to mention, you don\\'t know who got what where and what they put into it...unless you are growing it yourself, it isn\\'t 100% assured it is what you think it is...not that I am advocating growth, because that will get you locked up...as for beating yourself up, if you think you made a mistake, step back, analyze what happened and why you did it, and learn from it...life is too short to live with regrets and all we can do is live life the best way we can...  Well...obviously, she is beating herself up because of what my parents would think.  I told her, there has to come a point in your life where you look at what mom and dad taught us and accept and reject the principles to adapt your own...you cannot live your entire life for mom and dad because, no matter what, they will find something that could be better.  She completely agreed but said that it was a lot easier coming from me considering I never cared what they thought of me...I kind of laughed and said, well I don\\'t now but I did...in high school I drove myself nuts trying to please them but I was coming behind the girl they deem \"perfect\" so, like I said, nothing was going to make them happy...when I graduated high school, I gave them the proverbial finger and went about my own business.  It wasn\\'t until I was out on my own in Chicago that I completely made all of my decisions.  On top of that, I basically showed through my actions that if mom wanted to lay guilt trips, I would have nothing to do with her.  I think she finally got the picture that I was never going to be her idea of what I should be and gave up...to move on to the next sister, I\\'m sure.  I also told L that I would be lying if I said I still don\\'t get hurt by it...I told her, it is hard to listen to everyone else\\'s shining moments and then, here\\'s B.  I don\\'t even get introduced, B does.  It is like I don\\'t exist except to be B\\'s mom...it hurts because everyone else\\'s parents thought I was the berries...I got good grades, I kept clean, for the most part...but my parents thought I was the spawn of Satan.  Then my dad came home with the dinner...I need to get together with her to finish it up...  Then, Friday, I went out to lunch with Lis.  She started talking about L and how she thought this supposed boyfriend of hers was a real something or other...I don\\'t remember what she called him but it cracked me up.  I guess L went to see him ALL day and used some phony friend as an alibi...I mean, the friend does exist but she hasn\\'t seen her for YEARS.  Well, Lis started talking about all of her issues...I guess I got this look on my face and she asked me what I was thinking.  I just told her I was so worried about her and L.  I told her I didn\\'t understand where they were coming from because I never cared what my friends were doing, I just didn\\'t feel the need to do something I didn\\'t want to do to fit in.  I have never completely fit in anywhere so I got used to it very early and just decided what I wanted to do and what I didn\\'t want to do...well, I basically busted out, are you still smoking pot?  No...I don\\'t think I asked the sex question...unusual, I know but I didn\\'t.  I told her, just as I told L, I am NOT judging you...it is your life and you have to make your own decisions and your own mistakes...I just wish that my mistakes could have been lessons for you guys so you don\\'t have to go through the same heartache that I did...I am trying to take the same approach with you that I take with B...yes, I would prefer you guys didn\\'t do this stuff, but I would much rather KNOW and be able to be there for you guys then never know and be blindsided by it someday.  She also talked about being on antidepressants...I just hope I got through to one of them...I pray I got through to both...I worry about them so much.  And I kind of feel like I am the only one that can talk openly to them and yet try to be there...I know they aren\\'t telling J this stuff...she would probably pass out from it all...I know she means well but I also understand when they say they can\\'t talk to her because she doesn\\'t get it.  Her biggest \"vice\" was being taught how to play poker in college!  Sinner!  Anyway...I try not to worry, try just to be concerned...and I need to make a mental list, I need to be there and need to reach out to them more often...I\\'m very very bad at that but it is not an excuse...I need to let them know I love them and I\\'m here for them, no matter what...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nwhat a weekend...Friday, hubby and B went to TC so I was home alone.  I decided to get a little bit of cleaning/organizing done.  Well, I have not been satisfied with the way our living room is situated...so I tried moving the couches until I found a better way...none to be found.  But we now have a new gauge in the floor...yippee!!!   Please note sarcasm    Saturday, C and I headed to Chicago for the day...they had a memorial day parade right in front of our hotel so we had to find our way around it...lol!  Then we went to our room...the world\\'s tiniest hotel room!  They did not have a room with two twin beds yet since we were checking in so early...yuck! I was not looking forward to sleeping in the same bed (I\\'m weird about that) but I figured it was one night, I could deal.  We shopped ALL day.  We walked all of North Michigan and went in all malls and many shops...it is kind of funny actually since neither of us particularly like to shop!  I hit up H&M...LOVE that store!  I got a ton of cute stuff for the cruise and with the gift certificate from my older sis, hardly spent any $$$!  We walked down State but didn\\'t go down far enough for the cute little shops.  But we did run into a nail store so we stopped and I got a MUCH needed pedicure and she got her nails done.  I have never had such a good pedicure.  She took off the yucky skin and massaged my feet and calves...it felt AWESOME!!!  That night, we went to dinner and tried to go to this bar \"Leg Room\"...very cool inside but we were just to early so we beat the crowd.  Then we walked down to Excalibur...same thing, too early.  So we ended up at Hard Rock and had a drink and went to the hotel to bed...haha!  We were both laughing about what old women we are... next time, I would probably do TWO nights so if we have to spend all day shopping we don\\'t have to party the same night...  Anyway...Monday, B and I tried to go to Shrek II but it was all sold out...we went on Tuesday, it was cute but I\\'m still a fan of Disney movies...lol!  Weird that I feel I have to state my loyalties...it is JUST a cartoon!  I started this running program.  According to the schedule, I will be running 3miles in 30days...well, I\\'ll believe it when I do it.  I was going to do it outside but that requires me to buy a pedometer so I know how many times around the park is a mile...too much effort.  So, I am doing it on the treadmill...so far so good.  I mean, my bursitis and my knee are killing me, of course, but I am DETERMINED to do this.  I told hubby, it is my sincerest wish that on our cruise we can run together.  Doesn\\'t that seem romantic?  Running on the beaches of Miami?  I just see it as something we can do together and is good for us.  Hubby is slimming down rapidly.  I\\'m envious...proud, but envious.  I keep trying to convince myself, I am doing this for my health and I probably won\\'t lose any weight...but I know deep down, I see this as my last ditch effort to rid myself of these pounds.  Hopefully, by the time I admit to myself this weight isn\\'t going away, the program will be a habit so I will keep with it...I have to admit, it is kind of cool to use my body...\\n\\n'"

Because if I do, hubby will ask me what I want him to do about it...which makes me feel, if there is nothing to do about it, what is the point in being upset?  Which I agree with but I don\\'t...am I making any sense??? Yeah, I didn\\'t think so.  Okay...so, what I\\'m upset about...WHY do they treat me like crap?  I mean, I know I\\'m not blood but I am still technically \"family\"...I am married to their son and mother of their grandson...I just don\\'t get it.  Is it me?  Is it because they are just rude and ignorant?  I think if I knew the WHY of it all it would be easier for me to deal with...would it make it any less hurtful?  No...but I would be able to say, okay, they are doing this because they are XXXX.  But I don\\'t have that...right now, all it feels like is that they mercilessly poke and prode to see how far they can push me.  And what do I do?  They are FAMILY...I can\\'t cut them out of my life...they are too important to my hubby and to my son.  Say something?  I\\'ve already tried that route...that ended up with everyone pointing their fingers at me...everytime they do or say something, it takes me a little longer to get over it.  I hate this feeling...  Then the baby thing...I want one.  I am once again at the place where I am contemplating clomid.  Ugh...I make a decision I think I am at peace with and then I step back to re-make the decision.  Hubby says he doesn\\'t think he is ready to try it...well, that makes me mad too.  He would not have to DO anything...except things he already does.  I also want to ask him to go get tested.  Part of me feels like I wouldn\\'t obsess about this if I knew he was partly to blame too...part of me also feels like if he did have some issues, he could make some easy adjustments to increase our chances.  Ultimately, though...I KNOW that if it was meant to be, it will happen.

I just found it so sad.&nbsp; I mean, what an awesome opportunity that would have been to show these kids the BEST parts of our culture.&nbsp; It was so cute to watch them...I felt so bad for how terribly they were treated.&nbsp; They were just good, honest kids that were curious about a different way of life.&nbsp; It shows how open they truly are and how close-minded Americans can still be.&nbsp; However, I would dare say, the producers did this on purpose.&nbsp; I mean, was there a kind hearted person in the bunch?&nbsp; NO ONE stood up and say, hey, get a grip, these kids don\\'t know what\\'s going on...instead of mocking them, let\\'s help them.&nbsp; And Mose...my heart was truly bleeding for him.&nbsp; He was trying so hard to get these kids to accept him.&nbsp; It pained me but I couldn\\'t turn it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; It so reminded me of junior high all over again.&nbsp; I wanted to go smack those kids upside the head!&nbsp; His toys were very cool...and I felt so bad when he thought he was drowning (which I think, he really could have been).&nbsp; I have had the experience of taking someone to Lake Michigan for the first time...they had only ever been in small lakes and pools...it is VERY intimidating to someone who did not grow up in that kind of water to see these huge waves coming at you and over you.&nbsp; And, let\\'s face it, people DO drown in oceans and lakes like that.&nbsp; UGH!&nbsp; Can you tell how outraged I was???&nbsp; Mose is the one that really got to me...especially when they were showing him reading his Bible and praying.&nbsp; I didn\\'t realize the Amish believe if you are out of the Amish and die you go to hell...what a burden.&nbsp; And pretty amazing to me that he left if he really believes that.&nbsp;   Anyway, the end result...the Amish kids are really cool and people I would actually be friends with.&nbsp; The city kids...desperately need to grow up and experience the outside world.&nbsp; Pretty weird considering the premise, eh?\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nMy dear friend, Anne, sent this to me.&nbsp; It is so completely true.&nbsp; Hubby and I go round and round because he sees all the things we DON\\'T have and I focus on all the things we do have.&nbsp; Gratitude and thankfulness can change your outlook on life drastically...I know it helped me change mine.&nbsp; The health comment touched me tremendously.&nbsp; This is one huge area of my life where I need to spend more time being thankful...    A newly arrived soul in Heaven was met by St. Peter. &nbsp;St. Peter and the soul took the a tour around Heaven. They walked&nbsp;side-by-side inside a large workroom filled with angels.     &nbsp;  St. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter stopped in front of the first section and said, \"This is the Receiving Section. Here, all petitions to God&nbsp;said in prayer are received.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul looked at the section, and it was terribly busy with so&nbsp;many angels sorting out petitions written on voluminous paper&nbsp;sheets and scraps from people all over the world.     &nbsp;  They continued&nbsp;on until they reached the second section. St. Peter told the soul,&nbsp;\"This is the Packaging and Delivery Section. Here, the graces and&nbsp;blessings the people asked for are processed and delivered&nbsp;to the living persons who asked for them.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul noted again how busy it was. There were many angels&nbsp;working hard at that station, since so many blessings had been&nbsp;requested and were being packaged for delivery to Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Finally at the farthest corner of the room, the soul stopped at a very&nbsp;small station. To the surprise of the soul, only one angel was seated&nbsp;there, idly doing nothing. \"This is the Acknowledgment Section,\"&nbsp; St. Peter told the soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"How is it that? There\\'s no work here?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So sad,\" St. Peter sighed. \"After people receive the blessings&nbsp;they asked for, very few send acknowledgments.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  \"How does one acknowledge God\\'s blessings?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Simple,\" St. Peter answered. \"Just say, \"\\'Thank you, Lord.\\'\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  \"What blessings should they aknowledge?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  \"If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overhead and a place to sleep ... you are richer than 75% of this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  \"If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change&nbsp; in a dish ... you are among the top 8% of the world\\'s wealthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  \"And if you get this on your own computer, you are part of&nbsp;the 1% in the world who has that opportunity.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Also . . .\"If you woke up this morning with more health than illness ..... you are more blessed than the millions who will not even survive this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  \"If you have never experienced the fear in battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture, or the pangs of&nbsp;starvation ..... you are ahead of 700 million people in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  \"If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,&nbsp;arrest, torture, or death ... you are envied by, and more&nbsp;blessed than, three billion people in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  \"If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  \"If you can hold your head up and smile, you are not the norm, you are unique to all those in doubt and despair.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  \"OK, what now?

"female"	"'\\n\\nohmigosh!!!&nbsp; I just got one of the best calls of my life and I\\'m about to cry!&nbsp; One of my best friends, C, is PREGNANT!!!&nbsp; Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers that she will have no problems...see, C has been trying to get pregnant for as long as I have known her, three years.&nbsp; Seriously, this girl has done everything, chlomid, ovarian drilling.&nbsp; She was trying a new round of chlomid mixed with met (I had told her I read there was higher success with the two) and then, if that didn\\'t work, she was going to try invitro.&nbsp; The real kicker was the dr\\'s could not find out what was wrong...so she didn\\'t have a face to what she was fighting against.  Anyway...she said she started cramping and her hubby said she should take a hpt.&nbsp; Well, she did (Sunday morning) and she said it was positive...she started balling.&nbsp; Of course, she didn\\'t believe it because she had a shot of hcg (?) and figured it was that.&nbsp; So, she didn\\'t tell her hubby and scheduled a blood test with her fertility dr.&nbsp; The blood test came back positive!&nbsp; The dr told her it wouldn\\'t be the hormone shot because that was out of her system a few weeks ago.  So, she went and bought \"What to expect when you\\'re expecting\" and gave it to her hubby...he, of course, was ecstatic.&nbsp; She is still stressed out.&nbsp; I think when you go through what she has to get pregnant, you know worst case scenarios for everything and expect them since, up to this point, you have experienced all worst cases.&nbsp; I tried to calm her and tell her it is okay she isn\\'t feeling sick yet, she is figuring she is six weeks.&nbsp; I know I didn\\'t find out I was pregnant until 8weeks and that was because I woke up with sore breasts...it wasn\\'t until after that the morning sickness hit.&nbsp; I think it comforted her a bit...I was more concerned when she said she was cramping but didn\\'t say anything.&nbsp; We talked about what the book said, it says the cramping is caused by the uterus enlargening and her nurse confirmed that.&nbsp; Whew...  She doesn\\'t want anyone to know until after her first trimester...very understandable.&nbsp; So, only her drs, hubby, and I know...I feel so extremely honored...being the wonderful friend she is, she asked me how I was doing with the news, hoping she didn\\'t depress me.&nbsp; Oh, of course not...I am so so very happy for her...I think she is going to be one of the best moms I know.&nbsp; I know what heartache she has gone through, just wanting a baby so much...I could not be any happier.&nbsp; I tried to tell her this, of course, I don\\'t think she believed me.&nbsp; I seriously have had to deal with this so much this year, it isn\\'t as painful as it used to be.&nbsp; Plus, like I said, I have been praying for her so much, I never gave myself a thought during the conversation...she said, well, if I end up having just one, maybe that will encourage S to let you try chlomid.&nbsp; Haha...I told her, no way, we are shooting for 6 here.&nbsp; (Her test for the hcg shot had shown 2 perfect eggs, 1 other that looked okay).&nbsp; She told me that her eggs could actually split into 3\\'s!!!&nbsp; I said, well, than I\\'m praying for 9!!!  Anyway...I had to share somewhere, just don\\'t tell anyone else!  And, remember, pray your little hearts out...I have never known someone more deserving...I promise.\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nso, we went to the inlaws this weekend...it was interesting.&nbsp; Supposedly, my bil and sil were NOT talking to my mil.&nbsp; Well, hubby and I volunteered to babysit so they could have some \"alone\" time before sil goes back to work.&nbsp; So, we get up there, call them and they don\\'t want to go out...they would rather spend the time with us.&nbsp; Well, they did not get a \"formal\" invite to dinner so hubby acted as middle man to arrange it all.&nbsp; They come over, we all have dinner, everything seems hunky-dorey.  I notice that evening, sil seems inattentive when it comes to L.&nbsp; I didn\\'t want to pass judgement so I thought maybe it was just the crap with my mil.&nbsp; who knows?   Saturday we get up and get ready to go out on the boat.&nbsp; Sil says she will catch up with us later.&nbsp; We go out.&nbsp; Why do we always have to bring both boats???&nbsp; It makes for a very awkward time.&nbsp; Do we ride with dad or brother?&nbsp; So, hubby and I ride with my bil and send B with mil and fil.&nbsp; Mind you, I am still not feeling quite right...hubby tells everyone I have been having issues with my stomach.&nbsp; Umm...great!&nbsp; So now, everyone looks at me like I\\'m about to crap my pants...how halarious...  We stay out for quite some time...sil calls, still not on her way.&nbsp; By the time she got there, everyone else is ready to go but we stay out for a while longer.&nbsp; I start feeling awful so sil, mil, L, and I pack up while the guys get the boats in.&nbsp; We head out to the pizza place to order pizza.&nbsp; L starts screaming at the top of her lungs...not a whimper, full-fledge screaming.&nbsp; Sil just ignores it.&nbsp; She goes in to order the pizza and L is SHRIEKING...I mean, the baby is 9weeks old but I think she is about to pass out from how hard she is crying.&nbsp; Sil gets back in the car and continues to ignore.&nbsp;   So, we get dropped off at inlaws and we will wait for hubby and fil to pick us back up to go over to bil and sil...I rest (fall asleep).&nbsp; We go over there.&nbsp; Eat pizza.&nbsp; Get going.&nbsp; The dog is annoying, barking at everyone which makes L cry...sil still ignoring her.&nbsp; On the way home, mil goes off about how she thinks L\\'s problem is the breast milk because sil has not stopped to think about the way her eating habits affect L.&nbsp; True but I don\\'t know if this is it.&nbsp; Regardless, it showed both hubby and I a little insight into where mil is coming from.  Anyway...I remember a friend I have, h, that also knows my sil, saying, I don\\'t know if she will be able to handle a baby...it won\\'t be all about her anymore.&nbsp; I had forgotten that comment until this weekend as I am watching her...I\\'m still trying not to pass judgement but she was not like any new mother I have ever seen...and I\\'ve seen a lot!&nbsp; Usually, when your newborn cries your top priority is to figure out what is wrong and try to get the baby to stop crying...she could not have cared less.&nbsp; And, as I was watching her this weekend, I thought, h was right...she can\\'t handle her show being cancelled.&nbsp; Sad...  But, all in all, we had a great time which surprised us both.&nbsp; I had nightmares about babies both nights we were there...which was sad.&nbsp; It was a bittersweet feeling spending so much time with L.&nbsp; I loved holding her and watching her but it was tough because it brought my desire to have a baby right to the surface...  oh yeah...bil asked if they could come the WHOLE week with us to FL next year...umm, we offered two nights!&nbsp; Hubby said not a chance in hell...haha.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nS, in your Cinderella story, you'd get to Kiss the Prince       You don't need the pouffy dress, the fancy hair, or the 3-inch glass heels. A romantic soul like you just wants a guy who's a true companion, a good friend, a real prince. And if he's hot? All the better. But ultimately, you know that home is where the heart is. Which is probably why you surround yourself with good friends you can take care of and laugh with \\x97 friends who will do the same for you.But that doesn't keep you from fantasizing about the perfect relationship. It's not that you don't have your feet firmly planted on the ground. It's just that you're not afraid to shoot high. Or wish upon a shooting star. So keep reaching for your goals, Cinderella. If you do, your happily ever after can't be far away. And you can seal that with a kiss.\\n\\n\""

"female"	"'\\n\\nIt is SO hard to believe that a week ago we were on vacation...we were shopping in Nassau to be exact.&nbsp; So, here is a mini run-down of our vacation: &nbsp; Saturday: Drop B off at my parents, drive to Elmhurst for Portillo\\'s (YUM!), stop at Kohl\\'s so hubby can buy a watch (his broke Friday night), somehow found ourselves to the Park-n-Jet, fly from Chicago to Miami.&nbsp; Arrive around 8pm (I think) and wait for hotel shuttle to take us to the hotel.&nbsp; Get to the room, relax, go to hotel restaurant for dinner and saw the fireworks from the restaurant. &nbsp; Sunday: Wake up, go downstairs to find some info on what to do in Miami.&nbsp; Concierge hooks us up with a tour guide.&nbsp; Rush back upstairs to get breakfast and get ready.&nbsp; Meet Oscar for our 3 1/2 hour tour.&nbsp; Oscar, who is Cuban, takes us to Coral Gables, South Beach, and several other places...very nice guy...very cute accent...we got to see Julio Iglesias, Rosie O\\'Donnell, and Gloria Estefan\\'s houses.&nbsp; Hubby bought cigars from a Cuban guy...very cool tour... &nbsp; Sunday night we are hooked up with a FREE limo ride down to South Beach to go to dinner at a fancy Italian restaurant.&nbsp; First time hubby or I remember riding in a limo...fun!&nbsp; After a nice dinner, we walk down to South Beach but it starts raining so we go back and take the limo back to the hotel. &nbsp; Monday:&nbsp; Cruise day!&nbsp; We get up, get breakfast, get ready and go meet the shuttle to take us to the cruise.&nbsp; Getting on the boat did not take as long as we anticipated.&nbsp; We scoped out the boat a bit and had lunch.&nbsp; We go to a mini-seminar about shopping in Nassau and get some free stuff (jewelry, mug, perfume)...go to the casino and get lessons on blackjack and some poker game but I don\\'t remember which one.&nbsp; Have dinner...meet a VERY nice couple from Pennsylvania, not too impressed with the other couples (one couple can\\'t stop complaining about their food).&nbsp; Later on we stop in the casino where I lose $10 in the matter of minutes and I walk away.&nbsp; Stopped to watch the blackjack table and see&nbsp;a guy lose $500 in less time than I lost the $10...all of a sudden, I don\\'t feel so bad.&nbsp; Saw the show... &nbsp; Tuesday: Nassau!&nbsp; We get up and get out shopping.&nbsp; Promised hubby it would be 2hours, it was 3 1/2.&nbsp; Still not bad.&nbsp; Got a bunch of free stuff and some souvenir stuff.&nbsp; Afterwards, we go back to the boat for lunch and a quick rest.&nbsp; Then we head back out to catch a taxi to take us to Paradise Island.&nbsp; We go up to see the Atlantis and walk around for a couple hours...we aren\\'t allowed to go outside to the cool places which suck but serves us right for being too cheap for the tour!&nbsp; We go to their casino where I won $13.25 in the first push of the button (nickle slots)...I feel redeemed from the night before.&nbsp; Take a water taxi back to Nassau and stop by Senor Frog\\'s...two children ask us to pay them $1 for a song.&nbsp; Stop at the straw market...very hot...very pushy people.&nbsp; Go back to the boat.&nbsp; Attend an art auction, get free art.&nbsp; Formal night, we have a bottle of champagne and I feel drunk...haha!&nbsp; Go to the captain\\'s welcome for more champagne...is gross but free!&nbsp; Listen to the band. &nbsp; Wednesday: CocoCay!&nbsp; Get up, have breakfast, take the boat over to the island.&nbsp; Walk around the island and go get snorkeling gear and lesson.&nbsp; Begin snorkeling.&nbsp; See the shipwreck and airplane crash.&nbsp; Lose my conch shell bracelet...find it...lose it again.&nbsp; Get bit by a fish.&nbsp; Go have lunch and go to Aqua park.&nbsp; Realize the park is really for young kids and teens...decide we are too old and fat to get on a giant inflated see-saw and giant inflated \"rock\" climb (couldn\\'t get our fat butts up and out of the water!) Decide to stop wasting time and go back to snorkeling...go to the last lifeguard station and then head to the deep sea.&nbsp; On the way out, people are coming in saying there has been a shark siting but we see lots of people still out and figure it is a rumor.&nbsp; We see a lot of stingrays, beautiful colored fish, and, yes, a shark!&nbsp; Small one though...I had the camera so I had to try to swim closer to get a picture, don\\'t know if it will turn out or not.&nbsp; After we come in, we are told it is very possible large sharks were in the deep sea section as it is MATING season and they come into more shallow water to mate...beautiful!&nbsp; Go back to boat...see a show.&nbsp; Play the \"scavenger\" hunt game. &nbsp; Thursday: Key West!&nbsp; We have to wait for everyone to be cleared by customs...get pissed at same idiots whose names are being called.&nbsp; Get cleared.&nbsp; Get breakfast, head out.&nbsp; Call B, he tells me that he is being made to work on his vacation and asks if I have ever heard of working on a vacation...very hostile.&nbsp; Ask if he is having a good time and he says no because he has to work on his vacation...duh, mom!&nbsp; We walk around aimlessly...find the aloe store to get aloe for our sunburn.&nbsp; Find LOTs of beautiful jewelry but nothing quite my price.&nbsp; Keep walking around.&nbsp; Stop for a piece of Key Lime pie.&nbsp; Eat lunch at Hogs Breath.&nbsp; Walk some more...and some more...find a blue topaz I break down and buy.&nbsp; Start heading back to the boat, pass a market to shop at.&nbsp; BOUGHT some shells and a stingray doll for B...stop in one more jewelry store before getting back on the boat...bought a gorgeous mystic topaz in white gold.&nbsp; I feel guilty but hubby assures me I just get it.&nbsp; (He has bought quite a few expensive things for himself by this point so I\\'m sure my getting the ring makes HIM feel less guilt).&nbsp; Go back to the boat and swim.&nbsp; Take a nap and go to dinner.&nbsp; Pack and fall asleep. &nbsp; Friday:&nbsp; Get up and ready immediately, we have to be off the boat quite early.&nbsp; Get to the hotel around 9 or 10am.&nbsp; I order breakfast and we both take a nap.&nbsp; Get up, watch tv, watch Jersey Girl, take a nap.&nbsp; Get up, go down to gift shop for pop, take another nap and watch tv.&nbsp; Get up, go to hotel restaurant for dinner, go back and lay down.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Saturday:&nbsp; Get up EARLY to take shuttle to airport.&nbsp; Plane loaded and then find out valve is broken...delayed 45 minutes.&nbsp; Get to Chicago, get luggage, meet shuttle to go get car...head back to Michigan...stop at parents to give souvenirs and get Brennan...GO HOME!!! &nbsp; Okay...so this is the short version and there are so many memories in my head.&nbsp; If I figure out the picture stuff I will post some once they are returned.&nbsp; It was definitely the best vacation I have ever been on...even more special because hubby and I were ALONE for a whole WEEEK!&nbsp; We were nervous about it but it was just like old times, bumming around with my best friend.&nbsp; Made this week more lonely, but that is okay...it gives me something to look forward to when I have more time with him someday!  As for salmon...yes, it was my first time!&nbsp; There isn\\'t a good seafood/fish place in Kzoo...and when I lived in Chicago, I would always get shrimp at those places...I like the salmon when it was warm, when it was cold they had it too salty...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\noh lordy!&nbsp; My day went so badly yesterday...so the cyst burst and it was bad, bad pain...we went out grocery shopping, which I barely made it through and then I came home and slept...and slept...and slept some more.&nbsp; Well, we had invited the parents over for Key Lime Pie as an additional \"thank you\" for watching B for the week...so, they arrive.&nbsp; My mom asks how I was as I wasn\\'t looking to keen...I briefly explain what happened and we move on with conversation. &nbsp; Fast forward an hour...maybe two.&nbsp; Dessert has been eaten.&nbsp; Hubby, B, and my dad go out to play baseball.&nbsp; My mom decides this is the time to start planning my older sis\\' baby shower.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Background info: she had already sent out invites WITHOUT consulting with either La or I...SHE created the guest list, again, without input...and invites HER friends whom my sister has met once or twice...READ: this is really a party for HER, a social event for her to pull off.&nbsp; Now, mind you, I have lived with her ways for many years and KNEW this is what is was going to become... &nbsp; Back to last night...so, she had previously asked what I thought of having this restaurant cater.&nbsp; Stuipidly, I said I didn\\'t think it was a good idea because it would cost too much.&nbsp; So, as \"we\" are planning this, the first thing she writes is Restaurant X for sandwiches.&nbsp; ummm...okay.&nbsp; Then she asks, what would go with the sandwiches...to which I say, fruit and vegetables.&nbsp; What should we drink? Tea and lemonade.&nbsp; Should we have a cake? yes...and on with the questions...which I answered.&nbsp; All of a sudden, she puts the pen down and says to La and I, I don\\'t appreciate your lack of enthusiasm.&nbsp; WHAT?!&nbsp; (yes, that is what I actually responded with)...I just don\\'t think you are very excited about this and willing to help.&nbsp; To which I said, I guess I\\'m confused, you were asking questions, I was answering...besides, this is your party and I am assuming you are going to tell me what you want me to do.&nbsp; (Not exact words but meaning)...well, it went downhill from there.&nbsp; So, basically, there was my mom and I yelling at each other...me trying to remind her the ordeal I had just gone through....I have been trying all night and all morning to understand where she is coming from and I just can\\'t...she stomped out of the house and told my dad to take her home... &nbsp; once again, I\\'m the black sheep of the family...it is usually more fun than last night.\\n\\n'"
