This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.

"female"	"'\\n\\nugh...I get so tired of people projecting their feelings and emotions onto me...  bf called...told her I had two numbers for her x.  Asked her to really consider if she wants them.  I offered myself up as an example of how a spouse can take it...she said a) i would never tell my hubby, i think that was so wrong...and b) i am not looking to \"hook-up\"...excuse me?!  All I responded was that I believe honesty is the best policy even when it hurts...she said, if you were honest with yourself you would admit that you wanted to start something with mr x.  um, no...i have been honest with myself.  do people think that it is easy for me to admit that when i did call to get CLOSURE i was so messed up that i started re-playing a tainted view of reality in my head???  I mean, come on!  The guy was psycho...why was i such a lame-o that i considered it for a few days???  that\\'s honesty.  i am kinda upset but i don\\'t really know why i care.  i think because it just keeps tearing away the phisod of what i thought was a mature, adult, WOMAN friendship...it is a woman friendship...never able to quite get past the cattiness of nature to be real.  and to that i say UGH.  she also said something to the effect that she thinks her x still wants her...and that i will never really know if mr x still wants me because he never saw me now, just remembering what i was in high school.  ouch!  what the fuck does that mean?  and how the fuck was i supposed to react to that?  now i\\'m getting more mad.  i just am tired of people draining me to make themselves feel better and i truly need to stop giving a flying fuck.    on a happier note, since i am throwing around the f word...a guy i work with, who NEVER swears, said clusterfuck a few weeks ago.  I don\\'t think i had ever heard that one and it made me laugh SO HARD!  so now, whenever it is visible that he is frustrated, i ask him what word he would use to describe how he feels...to which he replies \"FUBAR, CF\"  interpretation: FUCKED UP BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION, CLUSTER FUCK  good day!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nahhh...still basking in the glow of home sweet home...nothing quite like the comfort and security of not feeling like you have to bust your ass to live up to a standard that is unattainable.  just being me...  So, this past week was when bf was in town.  He wasn\\'t available until Wednesday night...so I invited a few people over for dessert...not many could make it, only K and Ang.  So weird that Ang came, she NEVER comes especially if I am there...anyhoo...Tom was being a dork.  I had to call him to make sure we were still on, this is at 5pm...people are going to be showing at 6:30pm...he says he has to run a load of laundry through the dryer and then he will be over.  I make a run to WalMart...get back at 6:20...Ang shows up 5minutes later.  No Tom, No Tom, no tom...K shows up at about 7...no tom, no tom, no tom...no offense to them, but they were not very entertaining and I didn\\'t really want to hang with just them.  I finally call and leave a message for tom asking if he flaked...he shows about 8...whatever!  He looks good, really good, in a Tom way.  Someone told me he had started to look like his dad weight wise...don\\'t know what they were smoking!  He is balding a little but is slim and trim and actually dresses this era!  It was so strange to be in the same room, we hadn\\'t seen each other since a short visit in \\'97 or \\'98...I was so happy to see him...and I had absolutely nothing to say.  ugh...hence, why I hate socializing...what part of my repetative schedule would you like to hear about?  the part where I get up and go to work, get off work and pick up b, go home and make a pb&j, put B to bed, go to sleep...yeah, that\\'s the routine...not much conversation.  I didn\\'t really want to talk about the vacation...I was having too much fun listening to K spill the gossip on everything under the sun.  She was SOOOO shocked I didn\\'t know some of this stuff...and I finally said, I don\\'t really have the space to remember this stuff that has absolutely no effect in my life.  HA!  She just said, yeah, I never remember this stuff either....um, HELLO?!  You have been blabbering for 30+ minutes about EVERYONE...where does the not remembering part come into play...can we skip to that part???  Always hard to admit when you are the town crier...she actually tried to rope my mom into being the one to blab about something pretty confidential...yeah, right!  To which I said, \"K, if my mom knew, I would have been told before you were and I never knew...\"  THat shut her up for all of two seconds.  A) I don\\'t know if my mom would have told me, but I would hope she wouldn\\'t have told HER! and B) My mom could have told me and it could fall into the \"i forgot\" clause...but it was fun to watch her squirm:)  Talked to bf...she wants her x\\'s phone number...I did better, got 2!  Not sure if she really wants it so I want to have that discussion first...good lord, look at the mess it has gotten me into!  Later!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nAhhh...the sweet comfort of home!  Went on a week long road trip with the parents...hubby had training and races, so B and I bummed a ride to the vineyard and brooklyn...it was so nice to take a week off.  The vineyard was SO different than what I was expecting.  When I hear of the vineyard, I had always thought, beautiful green everywhere, rich, upscale...mmm, not exactly.  It was very pretty, I love water so I thought it was great, cars were everywhere, people everywhere.  It was neat...lots of cute little shops...lots of people with cute little accents.  My family made ourselves right at home in an italian restaurant...kudos to fernando's!  He was so cute...he looked as though he was tearing up the last night when we told him we were leaving the next day...but he maintained composure long enough to tell me he has never met a person who didn't like his tiramisu.  hmmm...mark it down.  Fernando, dahling, I don't like it...it satisfied the unrelenting chocolate urge, but as a texture freak, it kinda scared me.  But, I am sure it wasn't YOURS I am sure I would feel the same about everyone's.  It was good to see my sis...although, between my parents wanting to escape B and I and her working, I really didn't spend a lot of time with her...  Then it was off to Brooklyn.  Ahh, the big apple.  It was hotter than a mother there!  and of course, my sis's air only works in the bedroom, so I felt like I was receiving a steam treatment the moment I walked in the door.  We walked around Manhattan and SoHo...went to the WTC site.  When I was there last year, right after it happened, they weren't yet allowing anyone close, so it was really moving to see the huge void in the ground.  Guys were working...got to see the memorial everyone has been contributing to.  Also got to shop at the street vendors.  I felt it would be sacriligious to dicker with the ones selling wtc/nypd stuff.  So I just found what I wanted and bought.  BUmmed I didn't get to go to China Town and dicker with those vendors...that is the best part of NY!  Also, spent a few hours in H&M...the parents and B collapsed in some easy chairs and were almost passed out by the time I was done.  Went to D&DL...all out of chocolate covered expresso beans!!!!  What an outrage...no fix for me!  B was so good in the car!  The grandparent factor was working miracles...  It is so nice to be back home...i have come to so many revelations with my family, and made such great strides...I was feeling myself slip when being with them for so long.  It is so hard to still be the black sheep and the one who can never do anything right.  It gets old to hear them sing the praises of every other sister but never have anything nice to say to me.  It hurt.  It got old.  Glad to be back in the safety of my predictable life.  Glad to have a hubby who missed the shit out of me and couldn't wait until we were back as a family.  I think that is what hurts.  I don't think I will ever feel safe with my family...always waiting for the punch to come flying out of nowhere...you know it always does.  I love my family to death and would do just about anything for them, but at the same time, they drain and stress me out.  So, I was glad to get away but came to the realization extended family vacations are a thing of the past...  More later...I have to do some work-ew...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\ncool...my bf called last night and it was actually a NORMAL conversation...we goofed around, gossiped about the people we knew, you know, bf crap...near the end he got very preachy, but it was more understood from the other things he had told me.  it was good to know that our friendship hadn\\'t become all weirded out...  he is coming to visit! of course, he is arriving the week that I am going to visit my sis in Martha\\'s vineyard and my other sis in NY...but he will be here for a partial week once I get back.  He wanted hubby and I to go to Cedar point with some others...but a) hubby will be out of town, b) b and I will just be getting back, and c) some others are ones that i can\\'t stand for 2 hours...let alone, in a car, for HOURS and standing in line together for HOURS!  He thought it would be all cool because that is what we did on our senior skip day in which only he and I skipped!  yEAH, that would be cool from that standpoint but too many other eghs.  now, my other bf is upset because i told her i might not be able to come this year to TX...Pharmacia was taken over by Phizer so I don\\'t know if I will have a job by the end of the year...also, with this NY trip, it is costing what I would have spent on TX.  I just don\\'t know if we would feel comfortable spending that money so closely together...I used the cop out \"don\\'t know if I\\'ll have a job\"...but I don\\'t think she\\'s buying it...I told her I would keep my eye out for a cheap ticket but I can\\'t promise anything.  that\\'s all for now...I have to go work:)\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nyou know...sometimes you just have to laugh to keep from crying...  my boss\\' boss was supposed to get back with me on Monday about a raise I asked for at the beginning of August...when I called on Tuesday, he said that he needed 1-2 more weeks...whatever!  I am pretty stressed out...especially when I looked on line and found out I am making the lowest amount an admin is paid in the area...and that person enter with 0-1 years of experience!  I guess I need to get out of my comfort zone and start looking...yuck  To top it all off...Scott has cut me off...no talking, nothing.  The most contact we have had with each other is when I kiss him goodbye in the morning...We had an argument on Monday (?) night about his attitude during our phone call that morning...I had asked for some money for clothes...he said no...I WANTED to say a few words, but tried to take the high road and told him I should get off the phone.  He got all snotty and threw in my face \"Now you\\'re going to tell me that I treat you like...yadda, yadda, yadda\" Stuff that I said in our last \"heart to heart\"  Then I did get mad and said goodbye.  I tried to calmly talk to him about how that is not mature and we need to get beyond this so that we can have ADULT conflict...again, bearing my hurt, and my soul...he INTERRUPTS me in mid-sentence to ask me where the 6 dollars is from our date.  WHAT?!  I asked him if he was serious...he was.  Boy, was I mad.  Anyway...I guess this is all just proof for me that I am not psycho...if I bring up conflict he totally retaliates later...right after, actually.  So this morning, after the stress of work, the stress of my husband cutting me off, I don\\'t give him a kiss goodbye.  He gets pissed.  I said, you haven\\'t talked to me all week, yet you expect me to be lovey-dovey...I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t.  Then I walked out...then I walked back in and said, \"You know, the funny thing is that you can cut me off and treat me like this yet think that I should still be affectionate with you.  Which is ultimately, why I will never understand you\"  And walked out.  Looks like another great day...I really did not want to come to work...but staying home didn\\'t sound very fun either.  I just want to cry.  The girls asked me out to lunch so hopefully that will cheer me up a little!  Wish me luck\\n\\n'"

Then, we came home and watched a movie, drank some wine HE had picked up...and other stuff that I will spare the details.  Parents decided not to go to church so we got to lounge in bed all morning...wow, amazing what some much-needed, uninterrupted sleep will do for a person!  We went to my parents for dinner...had a convo with youngest about school...she wants to switch her majors.  Tried to give her some friendly advice and offer suggestions of people she might want to talk to...she FLIPPED out.  started yelling about how she didn't need me ganging up on her...ugh...i felt bad, she obviously thought i was trying to tell her what to do, which was NOT my intention.  sometimes i really wish that we lived thousands of miles away.  my other sis is completely ignoring/avoiding me...i think that i will no longer invest.  i can't stand hyper-emotional drama...over that a long time ago...so whatev with a capital W...if they want to talk to me, they know how to get ahold of me.  bf still strange...again W!\\n\\n\""

Hubby and I had it out tonight...it is rather ironic that it is always his damn counseling appointment that starts it.  Today was a new one...I am childish.  Isn\\'t the counselor supposed to help???  No, not ours...ours likes to give hubby fuel.  the great news is that he (counselor) wants me to come in next time.  Yippee!  I told hubby that i would but that i refuse to defend myself.  i mean, they already have it figured out that i am the root problem, so what can i possibly say to change that?  anyway...i need to calm myself down, so unfortunately, i will be major hyperv...i mean, ventilating... okay...1) knowing i was not going to see hubby for week when i went on vaca...asked numerous times for intimacy...rejected every time...lovely 2) when got back from vaca hubby NEVER and, yes, i repeat NEVER asked to hear the gory details of our trip.  I know his, including how many times he took a dump, but he doesn\\'t know shit about ours (sorry, bad pun) 3) roof leaks...hubby suggests i talk to the guys at work about what to do...guys at work immediately offer to help fix and tell me what weekend they are available...i am to blame because i took over... 4) hubby refuses to call dad and friends to ask for assistance...i get frustrated 5) hubby is supposed to call to rent a roofing nailer...waits until TWO DAYS BEFORE to do so...yes, i get very frustrated 6) oh yeah, hubby tells parents at races that we will be attending cousin\\'s wedding the weekend before the roof...then blames me and says that I am the one that told his mother...uh, NOT!  Then, gives no explanation to them as to why we won\\'t be attending...which, as covered previously in counseling, leaves them to believe it is MY fault 7) hubby tells parents that he is bringing b up with him while he will be chopping wood...no he NEVER asks me if this is okay.  he mentions that this was an idea of his...again, tells his parents that won\\'t happen and who do you think they feel is the problem??? 8) hubby calls everyday at work...almost everyday (I\\'ll give him 85% because I feel generous) he starts nit-picking and an argument with me WHILE I AM AT WORK and can\\'t imagine why i get upset... 9) cops an attitude constantly 10) still shows no sign of affection or intimacy for FIVE FUCKING WEEKS and yet, i am the one being childish because i suggest that this behavior might have something to do with why i am upset at him...go figure!  The saddest part is that hubby told me he just isn\\'t comfortable with close relationships.  um, duh?!  then you should not have dated me for four years...and married me!  this is what really kills me and really is my grand point.  he knew...HE KNEW...i had no idea.  i told him UP FRONT all of my faults...my temper, my lack of drive for cooking, i am madly high maintenance with sex and affection...HE KNEW.  on the other hand, he played a good game getting me to think that he was very affectionate and loving.  for god\\'s sake, he knows more about me than just about everyone...there is one person who may know more...but that is questionable.  that\\'s what hurts.  my best friend was all an act.  and for what?  a good screw?  please, he could have gotten it elsewhere.  i am not really sure what his motivation has been for these years.  but it hurts.  i mean, isn\\'t that was is \"so great\" about marriage...having your best friend live with you?  well, i thought that is what was happening...then reality set in and i find out i am living with a man who acts like he despises me...yeah, that\\'s great for the self-esteem.  i really wish i could get beyond the point of caring.  but if i go there, what do i do?  walk away?  not really the life i have envisioned for myself.  divorced, single mom, child in daycare 40 hours...yeah, that\\'s really fair to b.  what my roommate said is really starting to make sense...suffer through this stage...having kids and raising them...then divorce and find the real love of your life.

Can you tell I am very unhappy right now?  I just get very frustrated, which leads to anger, and I am so fucking tired.  I don\\'t have the energy for my hubby.  Like today, I asked if instead of hiking it to my house for lunch, b and I could bring some pizza.  Which, we had talked about us doing.  No, I spend too much money this weekend.  Okay, I spent $32 for Christmas shit...$15 on dinner (which was pre-approved by the $nazi)...will not be getting a puppy...and $17 at WalMart on stuff I needed.  Ah, hem...he spent a butload on gas to get to and from TC.  SO don\\'t act like I was the only one who spent $...but, after I am done typing, I am going to Lerner because now I\\'m depressed and I am sick of his shit.  ANyway, he has been picking fights with me a lot lately and I don\\'t know what is sparking it but I am done...he can have his shitfits bite my big ass.  So anyway, he told me no, don\\'t come to work.  Fine, I\\'m not coming for lunch either.  bf broke down first:)  She called last night, but b and I just got back from WalMart and it was 9, so I told her I would have to call back...I\\'ll probably do that tonight:)  Yeah...yesterday was cool...it was kind of rainy.  B took a 3 1/2 hour nap!!!  So I got to watch lots of RR...I don\\'t like to watch with him there...he is too young for the adult content.  I don\\'t really think I am ready to explain Danny and Paul making out with each other.  And I got to take an hour nap...  that\\'s all.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nmy goodness...it is a good thing that I am so determined not to get into my depressed stages anymore!  This week has been ROUGH!  see previous entry for one explanation...work has been so hectic.  I just celebrated my year anniversary--woohoo--and I\\'ve realized there are dry spells, really dry spells, minor work, and overload.  Unfortunately there is no happy medium.  This is the point I came into last year...with one team, it was a nightmare.  This year, thanks to my manager, I support 2 1/2 teams.  This is my lunch break for the day because I have so much #!@$ to get done.  Anyway...background info...refer to the 8/28/02 entry as to why I was already annoyed with bf.  I haven\\'t called her since then...I think I talked to her one time because she called.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I still love her...I still want to be her friend...BUT I am highly aggravated.  So, knowing how I am, I thought I would not talk to her until I can think through it and basically get over it.  And, for some reason, i haven\\'t gotten over it yet.  I have been crazy hectic lately, so I\\'m sure that has a lot to do with it.  Anyway, she called last night, after a terrible day at work.  I was bumming with Brennan...we were both reading, so I pulled myself off the couch to get the phone...she started off with some snide comment about how she hates it when I screen my calls...whatever, told her I had to pull myself off the couch.  She immediately jumps into how she can\\'t stop thinking about ex and should she or shouldn\\'t she call...but that she doesn\\'t want to wait until october 4th...the day before his wedding.  Then she says \"weren\\'t you going to call hiM?\"  Yeah...for about two seconds I contemplated that!  I just do not like him...period, period, period.  I told her I never did and didn\\'t want to.  She started to lay a guilt trip on me that she called Mr X for me and I owed her big.  Whatever, I guess I thought that is what friends are for.  I just said that she didn\\'t hate Mr X like i hated her ex.  I don\\'t do guilt trips.  So I tried to change the subject, she just laid into me for that too.  So I just shut my mouth...she went on blabbing and then asked what was wrong.  I told her I had a bad day at work...that I was overloaded at work.  THEN she starts \"Oh, poor you, you actually have to do work when you go in, instead of just getting paid to sit on your butt\"  MY HOLY GOD!  WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM???  I said ABSOLUTELY nothing.  Deafening silence.  A, look, you just really fucked up, silence.  Then she says, Who am I to talk? haha...no, no haha\\'s.  But, yeah, that brings up a good point.  You wanted a live in nanny/housekeeper and you don\\'t work outside!  I do...45-50 hour/week, have a house to keep up, a husband, etc!  So, yeah, I\\'m real fucking lazy!  She tried to recover but I was done by then and just was saying , mm-hmm, yeah, yeah.  Then she said, well I can tell you are in a pissy mood (YEAH...THANKS TO YOU!) call me when you feel better.  Okay, bye.  UGH!  Could I have just quietly mourned the 9/11 anniversary without going through petty shit?  A girl at work talked about how it was the firefighters\\' fault that they should never have gone into the towers...whatever, they were following commands.  And, as the wife of someone who is in that line of work, that is their conscientious obligation.  I don\\'t really think that anyone believed those towers were going to collapse.  On a special I watched last night, it said the first tower lasted one hour forty-three minutes.  The second lasted fifty-six minutes.  That\\'s a long time.  Long enough that you think you have time to save the thousands of people stuck in the buildings...personally, I am in high appreciation and awe at their efforts...I don\\'t think I could convince myself to go into that to help save complete strangers.  So, for all the non-believers and critics, there are many others who hold you in your much earned HERO status.  Ah...explosion at the plant on Tuesday.  A runaway reaction.  It basically exploded in a woman\\'s face and I just heard they had to spend 5 hours on her face.  She hasn\\'t been released because she is having difficulty with her sight.  Her lab partner had his major arterie nicked.  47 stitches for him.  He was just released today.  Scary.  On a happier note...I always watch our animal control PBS show.  Saw the cutest puppy so b and I went done to check it out.  It is a little girl, about a year old.  She looks like a mix of Jack Russell/chiuhauha.  There is one person ahead of us for her.  So I have to call tomorrow afternoon to see if she is available still.  Then I will pick her up on Monday.  Not sure if Scott will go for it, maybe it will be a SURPRISE!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nahhh...family time....  That should bring a warm fuzzy feeling, right?  Not so in the barto home.  It only brings anxiety, stress, and upset tummies...  My big sis has been in town for a week, so I have been seeing a lot of family.  Last night she wanted to cook dinner for everyone.  Couldn\\'t think of a good reason to bail.  So I went.  It was a hideous day at work, which stresses me out to begin with...so I had no tolerance for family issues.    I asked my sis about her birth control because my gyno wanted to put me on high dose to get me to have a period which would hopefully force me to ovulate...my mom started saying \"Oh, no...don\\'t do that!\"  Back off, mom.  She has absolutely no tenderness.  Thankfully, I was beyond stressed so I just told her calmly why and that I\\'m not in a back-off-bitch tone.  Then, as if I was asking for more abuse, I decided to tell them the great news the dr told me...that with a little pill, he thinks I will be able to get preggo.  This pill will make my body ovulate...which is what the dr thinks is my problemo.  I don\\'t really know why I thought that my family could be happy about that.  Because I\\'m a fucking moron.  I should know that my parents are so self-absorbed that they don\\'t give a shit.  A response of, \"yeah, but doesn\\'t that make you OVER ovulate...releasing more than one egg???\"  As if this was some mortal sin.  Yes, if I take it, we have to also realize the risk of multiple births.  But since I am not the perfect woman that you obviously were, my body won\\'t get pregnant without help.  And since we don\\'t believe in more invasive forms of help, this is our last chance.  And that comment was absolutely it...oh, wait, my older sister said she would be jealous if we had twins...so i have a mother who thinks i am interfering in something i shouldn\\'t and a sister whose reaction will be jealousy.  Wonderful...just another fucked up day in the world of barto\\'s...  Had to get out of there...ate too much dessert, trying to round up b so we had to take a potty break, because we are training (YEAH!).  Went into the upstairs bathroom...b put up the lid and said \"poopy\"...I quickly shut it again and tried not to hurl.  told b that we needed to go to a different bathroom because this was broke.  tried not to make a big deal out of it, but told lil sis she needed to take care of her mess and went downstairs.  it wasn\\'t \"poopy\" it was vomit...just like what we found in the hotel at the island...just like i\\'m sure was in the toilet of bennigan\\'s the night before...i hurt.  i know you read this, and i don\\'t really know what to say to you that i haven\\'t already said.  i fight the impulse to tell mom and dad...the only reason i don\\'t is because i can\\'t believe they don\\'t already know.  and i\\'m not convinced they have coping skills...they didn\\'t when i went through my dark time, and i haven\\'t seen a whole lot of change.  i don\\'t want to make things worse...but i don\\'t want you to think i am naive or turning a blind eye.  you need help...you need help...you need help.  i don\\'t know who from, i don\\'t know what will make it click for you.  but get it...embrace it...apply it...choose to use it.  this is not healthy, it\\'s scary.  if i knew of someone to \"tattle\" to, trust me, i would be on that phone.  but i don\\'t...i don\\'t even know the goddamn name of your counselor.  you have to work through this and get beyond it.  if nothing else, choose to stop doing it.  it\\'s hard, i know...it hasn\\'t been until the last six months that i have been able to throw open the closet doors to empty out the skeletons that haunted me.  trust me, i still have dark times...still have self doubt, self-inflicting pain--convincing myself i don\\'t deserve things, but it is a choice...it is a choice to entertain these thoughts, it was a choice to stop eating, it was a choice to have a psychotic boyfriend...you are choosing to vomit...to take diet pills...etc.  it must take an extreme amount of energy to continue this.  apply that energy into happiness.  I have told you before, only you can choose to be happy...it isn\\'t an event, it isn\\'t something that hits you, it isn\\'t based on life circumstances...it is the way you choose to view things.  it is hard at first, but it gets easier.  trust me, it is worth it.  it takes too much out of me to be depressed about the little things...and i was someone that loved to be depressed...i loved to complain...i loved the drama.  but being happy is so much more.  you have a wonderful life in front of you...think of all the time you have already wasted by making your focus this.  i hope that you tap into the strength i know you have to turn away from this.  i hope that you decide to wake up and grab life by the hand and take it for all it\\'s worth...and it is worth much more than hunching over a toilet for the rest of your life.  i love you more than you will ever know and i want nothing but peace, love, and joy for you.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nWow...I can't believe so much time has gone by with nothing to say!  Okay...not really, but I have been trying to do some soul searching and changing.  I have come to the conclusion that my hubby is my hubby and I love him in spite of it.  He is who he is and may never change.  I used to think that I would divorce and leave...but I don't want that.  I truly cannot imagine my life without him and do not want to have a family in which he isn't there.  So, I have given up being angry at him...I am still hurt, I probably will always wonder what it was that caused the dramatic shift in behavior, but I don't think that I will ever have that answer.  But I do not want to add him to one of the long list of people that have exited my life.  So, we have had a few heart wrenching conversations...and in the past 2-3 weeks, we have been trying.  It is not always easy, and for the first time in my life, I can honestly say I have successfully biten my tongue and OUCH did it hurt.  But, it is better to ward off the nasty comments then to ensue a WWIII.  My mother-in-law is a certified nut bag and has shown her true colors.  She called me and without going into gory details, tried to get my goat.  Thankfully, the soul change had begun beforehand and I did not let her steal my goat.  So, she was unsuccessful and then tried to back pedal.  Too late...you have already shown that you are trying to get me upset and when it didn't work she came kissing my butt.  Well, two can play but I prefer not to.  I will be appropriate and, when need arises, remind her that she must be also.  Hubby agreed that he needs to support me and that I need to feel free to stand up for myself.  My friends and pseudo-friends excluded me...it hurt, but it shows you who your real friends are.  And, now, I just ask myself, why do I continue into the same trap of caring so much what others think of me?  I need to accept myself...my hubby needs to like me...and B needs to like me.  That's it.  I really need to get beyond these juvenile things and find friends who will uplift me also.  My family...haven't talked to the sis in AGES.  She is the one relationship that I absolutely regret...I cannot tell you how awesome it was to finally have someone who comes from the same place that can understand you more than anyone else who has come along.  I'm so worried about her...and part of it is my fault, because I backed off and maybe I shouldn't have.  I didn't know what else to do.  I miss her like crazy but don't know how to extend the arm...i'm a chicken, what can I say.  We used to email and talk...now nothing...nothing since I left the island.  anyway...before I cry...  So, life has taken its unexpected turn of events...and like usual, there are times I totally mishandled it and times where I can be proud of myself.  Damn...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nWell...I survived, if that\\'s what you can call it.  It always amazes me how hubby escapes under the wire and i get all tangled up in it.  We didn\\'t talk about mr x which HIGHLY surprised me...we talked mostly about my temper.  I love how our counselor tries to put words in my mouth...it is so evident that if I agree to what he says I will get punted across the room.  Yes, this occured again Friday.  He tried to get me to say that if hubby showed affection and intimacy that I would not have a temper problem.  Uh, no!  NOT what I was saying....I said, I have had mad stress at work, family life, and with hubby...my hubby has no idea the other stuff that I have been stressing about...so that makes it worse.  However, even if he did his part, the other stress would be there...it is just that with the other stress his not doing his part makes it worse...I am beyond the whole \"i am an island\" bull shit...i want someone there beside me.  Boy, it was funny to see him back peddle on that one.  We talked about our lack of church/christian friends...I finally pointed out after two years that this was not my choice that this was because of hubby.  To which he told me that I could be friends independently of hubby.  Yeah, I do know that...but it makes it difficult when you never see anyone.  It isn\\'t like I am going to call up X and say...hey, I haven\\'t seen you for a year, you wanna be friends?  Please!  Counselor told me that half of everyone does what we do schedule wise and still finds time for friends...I have friends, just not the friends that I suppose he thinks I should have.  Quite a few of my friends are religious, I don\\'t know if they are Christians...heck, I don\\'t know if the people that go to my church are Christians!  But I am also beyond the \"you have to go to xyz church to be saved\"...yes, I believe there will be catholics in heaven.  Anyway...I disagree with the half thing...It is very different to work full-time but have both parents home at night...I am a single parent throughout the week (as is hubby)...we have family time on the weekends...It is alot of work, not being able to SHARE the workload.  It just aggravates me that he would say he was an authority on the matter...I don\\'t do babysitting much during the week...that is my time with B...and by the time we get home, he has had a full day and doesn\\'t want to go out.  I am not complaining...we chose this, we deal with it...but I don\\'t need anyone, who doesn\\'t have ANY idea what we are going through, to pass judgement on why I am to blame I don\\'t have the \"appropriate\" friends...hubby really didn\\'t have much to say.    The other fun one is accountability...every week we are supposed to basically sit down and bitch at each other about the week...what you could have done differently, what I should have done differently...does it sound like the breeding ground for war to anyone else???  Healthy conflict is what I have been striving for...not what I think hubby wants.  I basically said I didn\\'t like it and didn\\'t want to do it...got blasted for that one!  So, we are going to do it...lovely.  Ahhh...I hate griping so much so I will make this the last...church.  Why would you have all couples who are \"committed to each other\" come forward...yeah, i\\'m pretty sure it never crossed my hubby\\'s mind to go up...we didn\\'t and I think we were the only couple left in the pew...I was hurt at first, but now, I just am looking at it from hubby\\'s view...says alot to me about where he is at.  Was at grams everyday last week...whew!  I need a break!  It has to be hard to get to the end of the road and have to start divying up your stuff...I am so glad she is in town now...I just need to be able to keep sanity.  It is really amusing to see my parents.  They have no patience with her...I\\'m not sure why, but it makes me wonder if that is how I am with hubby\\'s mom...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nyeah...i\\'m getting nervous...tomorrow is my big \"summons\".  I printed off my blog because, as usual, the week of my husband starts acting appropriately and I need to remember exactly what has gone on.  she did it...she called her ex today.  i think it is bogus that she waited until 2days before the wedding, but whatever.  She of course was crying...she thinks he was sending mixed signals.  THe guy told her when they were getting off the phone that they would probably never talk to each other again...hmm, not sure what signal that was sending.  I shouldn\\'t be such a bitch.  I don\\'t really know why I am...I think because I am annoyed.  She is so whatever the current conversation is.  Like before, when she told me she didn\\'t have feelings for him...yeah, I pegged that one...then today, she said that it was different for me and mr x because i never had feelings for him like she does for hers.  I said, well, i did, in a weird way, but yeah, i knew i am in a lot better place...yeah, i need to get hit upside the head with a sympathy stick.  I mean, what if mr x was doing well for himself?  Then, it totally would have been harder to cut myself off AGAIN...and if, on top of it, he was getting married...wow...yeah that would suck...i\\'m a jerk.  I got my raise finally today...and now i have to go...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nWow...I didn\\'t realize how long it had been...and so much crap has happened.  Let\\'s start with the not-happy #$@! that way I can end on a good note...b\\'s birthday was last week, so we had his birthday party on the 16th.  my m-i-law had said that hubby\\'s dad wouldn\\'t be coming because it was on the opening \"Saturday\" of deer hunting season...but, low and behold, the bitch showed she is just out to manipulate my hubby because his dad did come!  Ugh!  Anyway...I had two crafts planned and then we walked to the firestation a few blocks away...now, when I had called, I forewarned them that the party was for a 3year old.  So the fireman that set it up said we would just have a two minute talk and then the kids would be allowed to play on the firetruck.  Uh, whoever that was forgot to mention that to our tour-guide.   He was an older gentleman...very nice, but VERY talkative.  He must have talked for 40minutes...at LEAST!  I guess another fireman rescued the parents and allowed the kids to start playing while the other jabbered away.  Thank yoU!  Anyway...as we were leaving, one of my friends pulled me aside and asked who my m-i-law was.  I said \"the short one\"  she, of course, had figured that out...based on past incidents I have vented about...anyway, my friend was standing with her son who had been misbehaving and had a time out from the firetruck and she said my m-i-law started saying how she couldn\\'t believe that I would do this for a 3year old party...that this was inappropriate and I should have waited until at least 5 or 6.  Thankfully, this is my friend who is NOT shy in the least...turned and told her how much fun her son was having and she thought it was a wonderful idea...that her son loved firemen and they had already been to his school.  What the #$%^ was my m-i-law thinking?  I just can\\'t believe she didnt\\' know that comment would come straight back to me...so did my husband...so the only thing left is that she is 1)a moron (already proven) and 2) out to hurt me (already proven)...so really, nothing new came out of it.  I just need to realize this woman is fucked up and that she will never truly accept me or welcome me into her family.  This weekend hubby got angry at me...basically it came out that I am supposed to be cooking, cleaning, and watching b...NOT doing \"fix-it\" work on the house...that\\'s a \"masculine\" job.  And he told me to turn in my two weeks.  I was devastated and don\\'t know what to think...I told him he knew that cooking and cleaning was never going to make me happy...and that WE bought the house together and that I enjoyed helping fix up OUR house!  What a crazy fool!  Ahhh...now that I have that off my chest...my bf called last night and asked if I would do a girl\\'s trip to Vegas in march...At first I was very hesitant about it...I seriously think that I am agoraphobic to a certain degree...I told her I would talk to hubby and then get back with her...well, I thought a lot about it last night and this morning and I am TOTALLY in!  Now, I am praying that it actually happens!  Call it kismet...I had two emails this morning for discounted rates to VEGAS!!!!  I am going to check them out but they seemed legit...one from Ramada...that would be so awesome and much needed!  So, I will try to get ahold of her today and tell her I am there...that also means I have to start penny-pinching!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nSomehow...I don't think this is a good thing!     CONGRATS! You're a Vampire! Hisssss! You're the oddball who sits quietly at parties. You rarely speak, but when you do, its usually so crazy that you probably shouldnt have said it at all. You dumb vampire.\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nhmm..what to tell, what to tell.  Hubby skipped his appointment last week because b was not feeling good.  I gave him a hard time and told him it was just because I have been \"behaving\" and he would not have anything to talk about.  In a way it is true...we both have been on our best behavior and it feels so nice to have my best friend back.  We actually can kid around and laugh together...amazing!  His parents came into town on Saturday and spent the night...boy, I have never been so happy to see hubby go to work!  No offense to my hubby, of course.  But, his parents can\\'t communicate with me so about 5 minutes after he left, they left...thank god!  It wasn\\'t as bad as I thought it would be, but it still wasn\\'t good!!!  Hubby brought up the fact that I have given up meat...you know, vegetarian...no meat...I\\'m sure you know what I mean...so, on Sunday, hubby\\'s mom is making dinner...a pizza thing that has pepperoni in it...so I ask her to please leave a portion without meat.  Seriously, she gives me a look like I have a gun to her head...and asks why...\"because I gave up meat\"...\"what do you mean you gave up meat?!\"  (Thinking, remember our 10minute conversation last night moron?!) \"I don\\'t eat meat...but if it is too much of a hassle, I will just pick it back out\"  \"so, does that mean you won\\'t let anyone else eat meat?\" \"No, it isn\\'t about a social consciousness\" \"what about thanksgiving?  are you going to make my son eat vegetarian for thanksgiving?\"  (now understand, she now has a tone that she is talking to a nazi) \"no, mom.  I will make a turkey but won\\'t be eating any myself.\" mom exits in a huff...what a freak!  I don\\'t know what her deal is other than she is a lunatic.  She talks about hubby\\'s sister-in-law like she created the moon...how very annoying!  I guess I need to be thankful that I don\\'t see them very often!  B\\'s birthday party is in a couple weeks...I pray that they are only coming for the day!  I am dreading the possibility that his parents and bro and wife will be staying over night.  If that is the case, I am praying for a mammoth migraine!!!  Other than that...my bf called.  B was being naughty so I had to let him go...still weird from his visit.  Actually, that was the first time since his visit that I have talked to him.  Other bf called...said she was in the hospital.  I never know whether or not to believe her...that is so terrible!  She was really shook up about her hubby and her x.  I feel her pain since I went through it...it just would have been a lot easier to support her if she would have been upfront about it from the beginning and not trying to blame me or rip on me about it...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nOkay...so I haven't been the most dedicated blogger:)  But, it is the holiday season...the time for madness and mayhem!  I am so exhausted and so not wanting to work...half of the plant has off this week...but I have $$$ in my eyes, so I am hoping to force myself to work at least three days this week.    The fam went to Chicago this weekend....it was fun!  Hubby, b, and I got up bright and early to go to IKEA...can I just say, I LOVE that store!!!  There were so many things I coulda/shoulda bought..but hubby reigns me in...plus, we had to meet the rest of my family downtown so we were doing some MAJOR power-shopping.  But I am one of those people that if I had a five minute time limit could come out with a hundred bags.  I know what I want...don't get in my way!  We all ate at Maggiano's...yummy!  Had some sinful desserts...then it was to the hotel.  Very nice...  I must give kudos to myself for not being tragically lost in the city.  I actually stayed calm and applied what I knew...my issue is that I know how to get to certain locations...I don't remember names of streets.  But we did awesome!  I am so proud:)  Then we went shopping...I much prefer fighting crowds in Chi-town than traffic/loonies in Kzoo.  I just felt like I was home.  I can never explain why...but from the moment I and all of my belongings hit that city, I knew that I had come home.  It is a place filled with so many different people...all shapes, sizes, colors, styles...and no judging.  It truly feels warm and cozy...like I have come running into arms of acceptance.  And as I ramble, I think I am realizing that this is what I miss...here in Kzoo there is nothing to do.  So everyone judges and criticizes.  Does it really matter that I don't have on designer jeans...that I bought mine for $3 at target?  But idle hands make idle minds and I think this is the disease of Kzoo life.  So, this weekend was bittersweet.  I hadn't been back since February...too long.  It refreshes me so much!  Yet, I realize as I talk to hubby, that we will probably never go back.  He does not miss it...he hates the traffic, people, cost...he says its too much.  So, I am not holding my breath to move back...just looking with anticipation for any amount of time I can be there to rejuvinate.  And, yet, I terribly digress...we were shopping, and shopping, and shopping...finally, hubby took b back to the hotel and my little sis and I went around.  It was alot of fun...she is the one that out of all, I have spent the least amount of time.  We shopped until our feet almost fell off--literally!  And then decided we should go rest...hubby got some krispy kremes...sinful!  And we watched a movie....b decided to get up at the butt-crack of dawn!  Too exhausting...we ate breakfast and left....we HAD to stop by Michigan City to hit the outlet:)  A little disappointing, but that could be due to how hideous b was behaving...  The fam was coming over Sunday night to celebrate christmas...hubby and I decided to have a relaxing Christmas day...so that meant no mad dash to get to fam's or have them over....so we did it last night instead!  I baked ALL afternoon long...man, my body HURTS!  I didn't get to sit down to about 7:30 and I had forgotten to eat.  It went well...I was more stressed out than I wish I had been.  All in all...a great weekend.  It's just a matter of deciding that someone else is not going to dictate how you enjoy your own life...and being able to apply that to family too!  Now...I guess I should talk about what has been going on in the past month...but I have to get planning the rest of my shopping (AHHH!) and Christmas lunch---why didn't I plan better?!!!\\n\\n\""

Whatever...I will find a way!  Vegas is for sure...I think...end of March, bf, her friend, and I.  So...I am committing to less eating, and excercise...I don't want to be the fattest one of us!  IT is hard enough to be the fat one of the family...but I will NOT be the fat friend too!!!  It sucks...when I focus on eating less, obviously I become obsessed with FOOD which I then want to EAT...ugh.  I am quite happy though...I just ordered a new Cindy Crawford excercise video and the Romy and Michelle DVD...awesome!!!  I cannot wait until they come in!\\n\\n\""
"female"	"\"\\n\\nI'm getting better...it hasn't been quite as long:)  I am supposed to be training someone but she got caught up so now I have some free time:)  So much to discuss, so little time...  Okay...my bf thinks she might have lupus...I don't know if I believe her or not, how hideous is that?  She has an appointment this Friday, so I hope she doesn't...we are supposed to be going to Vegas at some point...march or april...she wants to buy tickets and make all the reservations, but knows that if she is too sick she won't be able to go...my issue is $$$ I can't fork out cash for a trip that isn't going to happen.  So I have been trying to slow her down.  Also, I am extremely late on my period...and I am hoping for the best but expecting the worse...I don't think I am but I know my hopes are already high that I am...so I will basically be devastated if my damn period starts.  But, if I am, I don't know what that would do for the trip...I am at a higher risk of miscarriage and would need to consult with my ob before I did anything...plus, hubby may want us to save $$ so I would not have to work if I am...  Along that line...it is so hard not to have anyone to confide in about the possibility.  I don't really have a friend that I could tell...well, one.  But I don't want to tell someone, find out I'm not, and then have that person feeling sorry for me.  I just feel so isolated with this.  No one understands how worried/deformed I feel.  No one gets why hubby and I don't want to do anything but the natural way...I just look at b and think that I do not want him being all by himself.  I know that our siblings will eventually have children but how old will b be at that point?  And who is to say they would be close?    oops...gotta go!\\n\\n\""
"female"	"\"\\n\\nAhhh...isn't it lovely to be working on a beautiful Sunday afternoon???  I can hardly take it anymore!!!  I am trying to make up some hours that I will miss...even though hubby said it wasn't necessary...I feel guilty, so here I am!  All that is getting me through is knowing in only 2 1/2 more days I will be on a flight to Vegas...yeah, baby!  I can hardly wait!  I will be driving to meet my flight in O'hare and stop to shop along the way:)  I am bummed only by the fact that due to my rental car, I will not be able to visit IKEA...and I will be arriving to early on Monday to stop...bummer!  But, I will just use it as an excuse to go later:)  Vegas...here I come!  All day THursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday...four whole days of glorious freedom!!!  I pray that bf and I get along the whole time...right now it seems as though our eating habits will be what makes the difference...she sounds like she wants to eat the entire time...I gracefully tried to tell her that I can't do that unless I am tied to the crapper all day, lovely, eh???  Especially now that the curse has come to visit.  I am praying very HARD that it disappears by Wednesday, it could happen!  Not sure what we will do, Celine is not looking real...no response from the damn dj yet...I'll email Sabrina again tomorrow...maybe she can bug her again...she really thought they would be pulling through.  I told bf if we hit big while we are there, I would be willing to go...otherwise, I am not paying $150+ for anyone!!!  I am hoping two things...one, that I have a relaxing, stress-free time...and two, that I hit big enough to pay off a major bill...other than that, no agenda but fun!  Now, mind you, to succeed on number two, it must happen on the $50 limit I have placed on gambling...so, basically, if I succeed with number one, I will be happy!\\n\\n\""
