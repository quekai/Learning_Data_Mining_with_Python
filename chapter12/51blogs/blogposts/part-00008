This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages.

Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something.

During college it seems I always had a night class on Halloween (I know), and last year I was in Silver Spring, MD and didn't know anybody who was having a party or anything. So this year I have the chance to celebrate again, and I could care less. Can't I go to a Halloween party as the jerk-who-doesn't-dress-up? Every party needs someone wearing  that  costume.  What's more important is that I'm waiting to hear about my new job. No more wage slave slave wages! I guess I forgot to post about that. But I'm new to this. Well, I was offered a job working at the local public university. At least I was offered it by the department I'd be working for. I am still waiting to hear from the Human Resources department, which can take a while. Of course I still put in my two weeks notice at my present job. It just feels too good to be getting out of there. I will miss some of my coworkers, though.  Oh, and I gave up on grad school for this year. I came to my senses and realized that even though I could take some kick ass photos, I am applying for  film  school. But it is a little odd that in order to get into film school, they want you to submit a reel of films you've shot, right? I mean isn't that a little chicken and egg? Or cart before horse? Well, I knew in the back of my mind that photos wouldn't cut it, and I also knew that I couldn't get a short film done in time. This just gives me the time to do it right.\\n\\n\\n\""
"male"	"\"\\n\\n\\nurlLink Shocked ? I have trouble understanding how anyone could be at this point. The news coming out of Iraq has been filled with stories of attacks directly on U.S. forces. Why not a hotel in the middle of Baghdad? Honestly, it seems pretty obvious that the fighting won't simply die down and that the military can't keep order when they're not fighting soldiers, but armed civilians. The official war may be over, but the unofficial one seems to be kicking into high gear.  Well, I don't want to get myself into a discussion about war policy, but I began to wonder if perhaps the world would do well to watch  urlLink MTV's The Real World . I happened to catch the episode where they find out that the U.S. is going to war. The one non-American tried to have a discussion with his roommates about why go to war, etc. and he got yelled at by a New York girl who believed that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11. And sadly she represents many Americans. If people across the globe watched the Real World, they'd be sending us aid so that we might better educate ourselves and actually pay attention to facts and use reason.  Oh nuts.

And now I want to find some space I can permanently use for studio space. So I can learn. I just need money, which may be coming my way. I think I might get a new job. Full time, benefits.

I've seen some blogs where they go through their day, and it's interesting. That wasn't. Well, hopefully I'll have something interesting to say by Monday night. I spent some cash buying supplies so that I can convert my dad's garage into a photo studio for two days. My goal is to emerge with some photos, and perhaps even some Super8 film, that I'd be willing to submit to grad schools for my creative portfolio. I did some film and photo work as an undergrad, but I don't think it's anything I'd want to submit. I could have gobs of videos from high school and college of stuff I've shot that I don't like. Because before now, everything was for just getting by. Now I need something worthy of putting my name on it, and I have to hurry up and do something. That's a lesson right there. Always do your best. Or maybe it's don't eat the paste. Or something. I got it! Build a time machine and convince your younger self the importance of working hard.

But anyway, it\\'s not like most of us have become movers and shakers.

I think things have been going well as I have been learning the different processes and procedures of my new job. It's nice to have a desk again, the last time being when I interned for  urlLink Public Citizen  last September-December. Of course this time I can really dig in and customize my desk. What kinds of things do people bring to their cubicle or cubicle-like space? Maybe some photos, but I don't have many photos of family/friends that I'd want to put up. Not my style, I guess. Perhaps some photos I've taken (to get my head churning with creative ideas)? I'll find some little tchotchkes to bring in and put up. I've got some bumper stickers that I never... nah. Tchotchkes it is. So anyway, one of my non-secretarial duties may include website design or updating. I have done some stuff here and there that never saw the light of Day-ta, or has been slapped together for private use. In my nascent stages, I even mistook the &lt;frame&gt; tag for something useful and not horrible. So I did a little bit, and stopped. Since then, CSS became more standard. Now there are  urlLink some really neat things  you can do with CSS that tempt the  urlLink control freak  in me.

I'm sure by now everyone has read the recent  urlLink Onion article on blogging  which was linked to on Blogger's main page. I read it and thought it was hi-larious. Then I thought about it seriously. Would I want people I know reading my blog? I haven't really told anyone about it or directed anyone to it. I haven't put up an site counting code or anything to see if anyone is even reading it. I have to admit that I am apprehensive about sharing my thoughts and feelings with people. Anyone who knows me would probably say I'm very private or secretive. And looking at some of my posts, I haven't really spilled my guts out here, either. I just don't think to share a lot about my life, and often feel like a lot of it either isn't worth mentioning or isn't anyone's business. Maybe there is a paranoia issue hiding back there. I thought writing to this blog and in my journal would keep me writing every day and help me as a creative writer. I write in my journal at least as frequently as in this blog, and I write more there than I ever have here.

"male"	"\"\\n\\n\\nThat's how I would describe my first high school reunion. I drank around six pints, and just about everything felt like blah nostalgia. I didn't care to talk to many people there, many there didn't care to talk to me. Or maybe I should describe it as if it were a sitcom during sweeps. Anticipation was high. There were a few surprise appearances, and one highly anticipated cameo. The rest was just the usual filler. I am however motivated to write more. I put my chicken scratch on a number of pages on Saturday and Sunday. There may even be a good screenplay idea in there, and I have been getting more ideas as of late. If I can just keep up the inspiration...\\n\\n\\n\""
"male"	"\"\\n\\n\\nand somehow I am starting to feel the need to see it  now . Funny, since I didn't like the second one and when  Revolutions  came out, I wasn't interested in seeing it. And I usually get to see movies for free, so it wasn't the cost factor. Anyway, now for some reason I want to see the movie (for completion's sake), and it isn't playing around here and won't be on video for a while. I shall do my best to forget about it for now. I moved into my new place a few weeks ago (the day after my last post, actually). Just now getting the computer set up. No internet yet. I have been cooking for myself when I have the time to cook. I do a damn good job. Last night I made a dry rub for a strip steak and steamed some green beans in my steamer. Yum.  I also used Xmas money to buy a Wusthoff chef's knife. I have used it a lot and have also already cut myself on it. It is damn sharp. On another note, I was in the mall on Monday, and I went into the GameStop. I have their used game discount card, but despite seeing a number of bargains, I could not bring myself to spend money on a new game. The last one I bought was Legend of Zelda, and there are games I know I'd like. I wonder if this aversion was simply because I have spent so much money recently or if I'm just not interested enough in playing video games. However, I'm still playing Tony Hawk 4.

I guess they didn't know the tripod and reflector were worth anything. I didn't get very upset over all this. But now my car needs a new window and the speedometer doesn't work.

French has some spitting to it, but overall it flows far more smoothly and sounds more delicate to the ear. So I decided that the vagina should have had a more French sounding name.
