This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something.

I continually make changes to myself...and, hopefully, they are for the better.  It is truly amazing to see where I have been.

I feel like I have successfully excommunicated myself from them and feel great about that and now I am being thrown back into the lion\\'s den...ugh...it was rather humorous, he calls me to let me know he is getting married (I already knew, his mom called my mom for our addresses) after a year+ of not talking to each other.  So, he asks me if I will be coming to Dallas for it...I just laughed, assuming he was kidding, which he wasn\\'t so then he was offended and told me that it would mean a lot to him if I could make it.  I told him I didn\\'t think it was possible but that I would see him the following week at the reception here in Michigan.  Well, BF in austin called to ask why he was calling her...she then said, \"oh, you must be dreading seeing all of those people in one place\"...okay, so why didn\\'t I think of that???

"female"	"\"\\n\\nSar, your subconscious mind is driven most by Kindness   This means you have a deep desire to be kind and fair to others. You may even be preoccupied with finding kindness in the world around you, far more than you realize on a conscious level.   It is possible that the underlying reason you seek kindness in the world around you, is that you fear cruelty, the opposite of kindness. That could drive you to unconsciously project kindness wherever possible into your world. Regardless of its origin, your steadfast adherence to being kind to others is felt by people you are close to.   You are probably more susceptible than others to being overwhelmed by emotions \\x97 both yours and others'. It is possible that your unusually empathic nature is a result of your natural sensitivity to others' pain, and your desire to help them avoid it. For this reason, things might affect you more than they affect your friends and family. To protect yourself from too much emotional intensity, you might want to keep an eye out so you can recognize it when it starts. That will allow you to slow things down until you feel grounded again.   Overall, your strong orientation towards kindness gives you an optimistic nature, which translates into you seeing the best in the people around you. Because you're not one to be overly judgmental, others may seek out your company when they need a friend to talk to. People close to you likely know that you care deeply about the inner lives of others and can listen to what they have to say without imposing your views on them.   Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Kindness, there is much more to who you are at your core.\\n\\n\""

"female"	"'\\n\\nI\\'m so frustrated...how can you judge someone when you have NO idea what they are trying to explain???  One of my \"friends\" came over this morning and started talking about her husband.  She recently told him she was going to file for a divorce so he has been trying to manipulate her and, basically, acting like a child.  Anyway, the discussion somehow led into my dr\\'s appointment.  She asked if it went well.  I told her it was fine, my meds were changed, he added the fish oil...blah, blah, blah.  I guess I had never told her specifically I have been diagnosed PCOS.  I guess it just isn\\'t something I throw out to people.  I don\\'t want anyone to feel sorry for me, I don\\'t really want to have to talk about it.  I don\\'t want to get mad when you, my best friend, are supposed to feign concern for me and forget I might have issues...it just saves me a lot of headache and heartache to just not go into detail.  Anyway...she wanted an explanation of what it is...which led into, how were you diagnosed?  Well, how was I going to explain this???  So, I started at the beginning, when I first was diagnosed with hypothyroidism...well, how did you know something was wrong?  How do you know you were eating right and you should have been losing weight?  At some point, it just got easier to say, \"Look, I was anorexic, weight is a huge thing.  I was busting my ass to lose and I wasn\\'t so I knew something was up and I was concerned I would start practicing again.\"  Lordy...   note to self: a)don\\'t tell people you aren\\'t convinced give a shit what you are actually saying and aren\\'t just waiting for the opportunity to judge b) probably not a good idea to get into this type of conversation at work.   So, I guess by telling her I\\'m anorexic that meant I was really dying to know what she thought about eating disorders.  Ummm...have you ever even KNOWN someone with one?  Judgement, judgement, and, yes, more judgement.  After she was done with that rant, she went into \"You really should try NOT taking the meds to see what will happen.\"  Oh, yes, that is a brilliant idea!  I have been on these fucking meds for 9months and my hormones are still not under control...lets dump the meds and send them raging again to realize I really MUST take these meds...that makes complete sense to me!  How \\'bout this?  You go fucking read some literature on a) thyroid disorders and b) PCOS and then come back and we can have an intelligent conversation.  At some point, she told me I had no business being on met because it is a drug for diabetics and I\\'m not diabetic.  (Mind you, I was the one who told her it is for diabetics).  To which, I graciously replied, you really should read some lit on PCOS and then you would understand the reasons MET is working for us.  Okay...I know, I\\'m being oversensitive but I am just so frustrated!  Does she think I don\\'t know that she and everyone else judges me on my weight?  I know, I need to lose weight...I know, in a perfect world it would fly off.  But I have tried over and over...come up with new ways to attack.  Besides the depression I sink into when the new method sucks as much as the others and no weight is lost, I have to be careful.  I am obsessed with the way I look, obsessed with the weight.  Everytime I find out the number I am fighting those demons.  I don\\'t want to go back to where I was in high school but I often contemplate it.  I don\\'t even want to admit this because I am riding the fence right now.  Surely, it can\\'t be bad to cut out all meals but one? blah, blah, blah...yeah, they are right over my shoulder tormenting me.  Then, we have the ever present question of \"so when are you having another?\" \"why are you waiting so long?\" \"do you just want one?\"  JESUS CHRIST!  I really thought I was doing well but last night I dropped B off at his church program and saw one of our \"friends\".  They had their first when B was two and now they were toting around another...it\\'s tough...I\\'m not going to lie, I want that to be me.  I think I am just getting apprehensive about M\\'s shower...plus, I don\\'t know if I have mentioned it, my sister is pregnant.  I am thrilled for her, I was worried that she too may be cursed with this so I am so grateful she is not (at this point).  At the same time, there is a small little piece that wants it to be me...  I guess it is just the ignorance...especially the blissfully ignorant.  They don\\'t give a shit what is really going on, they just want to scream at the top of their lungs and have people listen to them.  Guess what, genius?

Seriously...I didn\\'t know what a swearword was until 4th grade...I barely knew NKOTB...I didn\\'t drink until I was 20...AND I never watched a complete Molly Ringwald movie until last night!  It is hard to explain to people how conservative my parents were because they end up sounding like Nazis.  I hated it at the time but I look back at what my friends started doing in middle school and high school and am glad to have been saved.  Not that I think I would have given in to peer pressure, I was always the person marching to her own beat but I would have become aware of my individuality a lot sooner...  So \"Pretty in Pink\" was the movie I watched last night...it was good!  Sometimes when you watch old movies they drive you nuts because they are the old school bad effects, etc. but this was not like that.  I think my favorite part was when Duckie was lip synching...halarious!    I must say, I so identified with Andie in high school...I was the girl hanging out with all the preps spending all their money on clothes.  I just wasn\\'t that way.  It wasn\\'t that my parents didn\\'t have money but I was raised to be frugal so for me, a complete outfit for $15 was much more of a high than getting designer jeans for $90.  I probably committed many fashion faux pas while bargain shopping but it didn\\'t matter to me...I was different and I was made well aware of that by everyone.    At church I didn\\'t fit in because that is where all my preppy friends went so I wasn\\'t in designer duds like they were, I didn\\'t party and get trashed like they did, I chose my friends over my boyfriend, and the list could go on and on.  At school I didn\\'t fit in because I was seen as the \"elite\" crowd.  My mom was a teacher, my dad was president of the school board, I was the top of my class, and involved in any extra-curricular activity available.  It was kind of humorous because at church I was a prude and weird because of the way I dressed...at school I was the trend setter.  Talk about schizophrenia!  Then there was the situation with the boys.  I felt bad for Duckie last night...and it made me realize what my guy friends must have felt like in high school.  It wasn\\'t until a few years after high school that I realized the guys that I considered my best friends had, at some point in high school, wanted to date me.  And I\\'m sure they felt I was so self-absorbed in my life that I was just being callous...but that really wasn\\'t it.  I didn\\'t have any idea in high school these guys liked me like that!  I had gotten so used to being the eccentric girl that everyone is friends with but no one remembers to include, I just figured these guys were the same...they provided much less drama than the girls...they were like brothers to me.  I found a lot of solace in these guys and I would have done anything for them.    So the lesson, kids, is this...if you like someone or think you are in love with them...tell them.  Maybe she isn\\'t being cold, maybe she isn\\'t just using you...maybe, just maybe, she doesn\\'t like herself so she would never dream someone else could either...  To be honest, as I\\'m sitting here thinking and remembering back, I don\\'t know what I would have done...I don\\'t know what would have happened if one of them asked me out on an actual date...and maybe they did and maybe I missed it...maybe I just thought we were hanging out like we always did...I had a boyfriend off and on in high school so I don\\'t know...I just know life is too short to ask the what if\\'s...you have to just grab it by the horns and hold on...   in pink, of course!\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nouch!  My body is killing me...ironically, it feels good.  It is nice when you can get normal responses from the vessel you occupy.  Plus, it reminds me of how much I accomplished this weekend...wow!  I impress myself...haha!  Friday...endo appointment.  Not as bad or as good as I would have expected.  I am basically where I was weight wise last fall...bummer, but at the same time I know how much I was gorging on when I was depressed this winter.  Plus, it is down from my gp appointment so I know it is at least budging.  CV told me I need to stick to the PCOS diet thing but start counting calories.  He said fruit is full of them and I need to be aware so I am not counteracting my proactive approach.  He also agreed that perhaps the fish oil is a good idea...though it counts toward my calories!  He said it will hopefully help kick my metabolism into gear, help with the IR, acne, etc and help me start losing weight.  On the other hand, my thyroid is uncontrollable...he said he is not sure why the increased dose did not work but he is increasing it again and re-checking in six weeks.  If it is still not at the correct level he will have to change it again...ugh...it sucks when it is the thyroid, that\\'s the one that makes me want to sleep all day when he changes it.  On the plus side, he does not want to increase the met.  He is hoping the change in thyroid and the fish oil will help and my met can stay the same.  So now I am up to 6 pills a day...7 if I would start taking a multi-vitamin.  Lordy...I hate the responsibility!  On Friday night, hubby and I watched \"Radio\" with Cuba...good movie!  Not what I was expecting (I just knew it was a movie about football) but definitely a good watch...  Saturday we went up to B & J\\'s house...we haven\\'t seen them in a year so it was great to finally see them and catch up.  Both hubby and I love J...we were apprehensive as B never seems to pick out someone that is not self-absorbed but we could both tell that she loves him so much and they seem to take care of each other.  They are getting married on June 5th...I am so happy for him, he seems so happy, so content.  I pray this is the one and they live a long life together...  When we got home, we saw the mess Spike made.  Hubby is so ready to get rid of him...he tore a hole in our brand new carpet...I am sick everytime I see it, it hasn\\'t even been a month since we had it installed!  He was trying to get into our bedroom and gauged the door and tore a huge hole in the carpet.  He got down to the furring strips and cut himself so in addition to the huge hole, we had blood spots randomly on the carpet.  Thankfully, he is fine (it must have been a small cut) and the spots came right up...but our poor carpet.  I called the carpet place and they put our name on a board for one of their installers to come do it on the side.  I\\'m sure it won\\'t happen before our families came over...damn...  Sunday...woohoo!  The weather was awesome!  B woke up at 7am telling us how much he likes to hear the chirp chirp...I\\'m not sure that he realized it was the birds so I explained that to him and then he was going on and on about how beautiful it was...too funny!  So, hubby was supremely irritated that B was awake so early...I got him into a sweatshirt and we went out to start working.  I cleaned out the garden and weeded...it took about 1 1/2 hours and then we went in for breakfast.  Then, I decided to clean our throw rug and brought that outside to scrub...which led to the scrubbing of the other one...then I took comet to all the dirt on the walls and scrubbed down everything...then I went to the basement and worked some more on cleaning/organizing that...when hubby left for work, I took a rest (read nap!) while B watch \"Lady and the Tramp\".  When that was done, we went back outside and I did some transplanting...then, I worked some more in the basement.  After B went to bed, I cleared out the dining room and living room so I could do a complete vacuum and waxing of the floors.  I didn\\'t want to wait until this weekend because they get so slick and I really don\\'t want anyone wiping out when they come over...it is spring!  I have my mother to thank for this disease...but I feel so much better when everything is in its place and clean...I told hubby I was coming to a fast realization why my mom had four daughters...she could direct while we cleaned!  I need to train hubby and B how to do this stuff...  It\\'s Monday...I don\\'t want to work...\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nHey...I think I figured it out!  Well, not really...but I read a discussion on unkymoods.com about it and was able to follow the directions...yippee!!!  So, yeah...one blaring realization...I\\'m old...now, mind you, I should have known going into a teeny-bopper concert.  However, I really don\\'t view myself as old, just a young spirit trapped in an old body.  So, we get to the concert and I immediately have to go to the bathroom.  Well, there is a poor soul whose job is to direct all the crazy women trying to use the bathroom.  \"You go here, I need four more ladies to come over here...\" Basically, directing traffic.  So, I\\'m next and she says, \"Mom, you just go right over here...\"  CRAP!  I mean, yeah, I\\'m a mom but not of someone old enough to come to this concert!!!  She was probably assuming that someone of my age would not be coming unless they were with child.  So, there were two opening acts...bummer, the first guy was really good but I couldn\\'t understand what he was saying his name was...he had kind of a caribbean feel but was alternative.  Well, we missed the second opening, Skye Sweetnam...can\\'t say I know who she is or cared, I was too busy hitting the souvenir stands with the girls...that was a trip.  Of course, being the uber-dork, I bought a pink newsboy...will I ever wear it???  Doubtful.  I don\\'t foresee a situation where that would be perfectly appropriate.  Well, R\\'s daughter wanted same hat but in black.  The first stand sold out by the time we got to the front...so we go to another.  Last one is on display and I tell the guy that is what we want.  He informs me he is not allowed to sell the display.  So, I\\'m trying to convince him it is okay because they sold the display at the last stand...while we are having this discussion, another worker reaches behind him to take it and sold it!  At that point, I was pissed!  He couldn\\'t tell me if they would get more and wanted me to go to yet another stand and wait in line for 20 MORE minutes.  I know it sounds stupid...but I felt bad, it is A\\'s birthday and the poor girl just wanted a hat!  (No need to worry, the first stand got some more and she got it...whew!  LOL)  Anyway...the concert starts...please, do not buy tickets to the balcony or upper tiers...mind you, we were at the front of the first balcony but we did not get the full effect of people dancing and going nuts.  I had to sit there like a sane person...bummer.  It was a good concert.  Would I go see her again?  Probably not unless I got the tickets for free or I had awesome seats.  I just didn\\'t get to see the dancing like I wanted to because we were too high up.    It surprised me that the pop princess was so sexual.  Mind you, I was raised in an extremely conservative home but I have been hearing that many parents get up and take home their young children so as not to taint their impressionable minds.  I\\'m talking whips, dry humping, threesomes, guys on guys, girls on girls...a little over the top.  At the same time, did these parents not see ANY coverage on the tour???  I had heard about this right after it opened...granted, you may have already bought your tickets but you can\\'t tell me you couldn\\'t have sold them!  However, all this sexuality was only overpowering for 2-3 songs...it was kind of cool because she had a costume like the one in the toxic video where she is only wearing jewels...if I had a kicking body like that, I would be tempted to dance around in one of those too!  She explained her voice was out of whack because she has been ill but really only the song \"Everytime\" suffered...of course, that is my favorite other than \"Slave to you\" but it was cool...I didn\\'t realize she could play piano either...  I called L while I was there...I know she answered but I couldn\\'t hear anything she was saying...I tried calling her again after we were out but she was probably out partying by then.  I hope she heard some of the concert, I wish she would have been there too.

He also mentioned that he was tired of trying to figure out what everyone else wanted to do for his birthday so she could figure it out with his brother and to call us when they knew what time we should be ready for them to come.

Saturday...hubby has been wanting another tattoo...so, we woke up and I told him to go forth and get ye tattoo...not as a birthday present, per say, but for his birthday he could get the tattoo...so, he has his superman emblem.  It looks pretty cool.  He \"said\" he wanted to get my initials and b\\'s initials somewhere but he didn\\'t know where to do it.  He had thought about it as an addition to the tribal band on his arm but he didn\\'t know if that would look right.  I told him I would much prefer it on his penis...\"if found please return to slh..\" haha.  I told him it would keep him honest...somehow, he didn\\'t find the humor in that!  So, we are still trying to figure out what we are going to DO for his actual birthday.  His family drives me CRAZY...now, his brother and his wife won\\'t come to spend the night because they think it will hurt his parents\\' feelings.  They \"offer\" to come down for lunch and then they will go back to TC...gee, thanks, you\\'ll spend a whole hour with us???  So, now, hubby feels like he has to invite his parents, brother, sister in law, and my family to the house for dinner, cake, and ice cream.  Actually, a late lunch...but whatever.  So, I had thought I would take him to a Tigers game on Sunday...well, he doesn\\'t want to do that either.  I\\'m not trying to be all emotional or bitchy but JESUS CHRIST!  Can\\'t I come up with SOMETHING to do for your birthday that you will actually want to do?  I was going to have B go to my parent\\'s house to spend the night on Saturday, have us get up for breakfast and go to the game but he doesn\\'t want B to be gone from us...ummm, he ALWAYS wants a break...okay...he suggests B go to my parents on Friday night instead...no good, I\\'m going to be cleaning and cooking for your goddamn family all night, I\\'m not going to be able to go out that night.  It is just extremely frustrating...and he doesn\\'t get why my feelings would be hurt that the last 50+ ideas I have come up with have been shot down and massacred...  I know...it isn\\'t about me, it is about him...but how can it be about him when he won\\'t let me do anything?

So, for about 5seconds I seriously contemplated just letting her leave a message...but I wanted to hear what she had to say and get all of this shit over with if that was her intention...  So, I answered, said hello, nothing else...not rude but not warm and inviting like usual either.  She asked if B was in bed because she needed to talk to me and didn\\'t want me to be distracted or not able to talk.  B was in bed, I have no idea if he was actually sleeping but he wasn\\'t hollering for me.

I didn\\'t let it just go though...I figured I had a right to let her hear it from me how I felt...so I told her.  I said I was very hurt by the fact she refused to talk to me that night, that dad turned around and told j that I had chewed her ass, and by them not trying to make it right with me I felt like I was not welcome as part of the family.  She apologized again and told me it was never her intention to hurt me...she was taken aback when I called, dad jumped to conclusion (they never discussed what actually happened until THIS week!!!), and I\\'m one of two of the only \"daughters\" she will have.  I told her I forgave her...told her again that it meant a lot to me that she called...and that was that...

Okay....but do I really think I am always right?  Ummm...I don\\'t know.  I am a highly opinionated person, yes, but I don\\'t  think  I am always right...do I?  See, I know I USED to do that but I didn\\'t think I was that way anymore...I actually think that every person is a set of circumstances that make them who they are and influence the choices they make and the way they live their lives...who am I to question/judge someone?  I have not lived in their shoes, nor have they lived in mine...my mommy would be so disappointed.  She is of the opinion that almost, if not all, things are black and white...I think we live in a mostly fuzzy gray world.  The point is, if I do behave like this, I feel really bad...I mentioned to hubby that there aren\\'t a lot people who I really care to know what they think of me...he is the number one person I care about...I don\\'t want him to think that I have this over the top opinion of myself in which I am right and he is wrong all the time...obviously, it happens naturally a lot of the time...haha!  As for the birthday...as hubby said, we are on plan D.  The master plan: VEGAS...shot down because of money needed for cruise...plan A: Big birthday party...gone, hubby doesn\\'t want a huge crowd just for him...plan B: A family party...no good, I told hubby I am willing to invite his family but I think he is thinking it won\\'t work...could be true but I feel bad, it is HIS birthday...plan C: His brother and sil coming down for the weekend...now, this one is not completely out but gets a little tricky...I guess I will call the sil and tell her party is out and dance around the issue if they still want to come down.  Hubby would love to spend time with his bro but don\\'t want his parents upset they weren\\'t invited...makes sense, but I don\\'t really care how they feel right now...SO, if that doesn\\'t work (or maybe I will go in correlation with plan C) is plan D: a baseball game...hubby has been wanting to go see the Tigers play for quite some time and ironically, they do have a game on his birthday...I don\\'t know if it is a \"real\" game or a pregame, but does it matter that much???  Oh, yeah...mil is a fruitcake...she actually asked hubby if we would come up for Easter when they were on the phone...I TOLD him that she would assume I was just going to  get over  what happened!\\n\\n'"
