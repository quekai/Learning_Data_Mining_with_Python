This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.

"female"	"'\\n\\nHave I ever mentioned, you always get fucked at the drive through...those were words of wisdom I learned when working with AOC in Chicago...whoever went for lunch got screwed...either out of money or out of food.  But, somehow, I was always the one to go get the food...  Once again, I find myself in this type of situation but there is not much I can do about it.  See, although I work for the largest pharmaceutical company in the US, I am not technically their \"employee\"...I work through a company...for FOUR years I have done this, originally I was given the title \"contract worker\" now I have been demoted to \"temporary worker\"...when I went to get my badge renewed the security guy says, you are the longest working temp I know!  Attempting a joke, I\\'m sure, as many people here are in the same boat...and yet, I digress.  So, 5 weeks ago, my records indicate I am eligible for my shitty one week paid vacation.  I put it on my timesheet, expect to get paid the following week.  Not so, senora.  Rather than my company call me and let me know what is going on, they wait until I see the correct amount was not dd and I call them...have I mentioned they are a bunch of lazy losers?  So, it was then that Ms. Rodriguez tells me that their \"NEW\" policy says I have to have 1800 hours (instead of 1500)and those hours had to be accumulated AFTER the last vacation pay.  Well, well...the slimey bastards have come up with yet another way to screw me out of money.  Now, I can ONLY earn one week a year AND you just ripped away 200+ hours from last year when this policy WAS NOT in place.    Fast forward to last week.  Once again, I have satisfied all NEW policies communicated to me, so I send in vacation request.  Call Ms R to verify this is true, she confirms.  Call again to bring attention to the vacation request.  Talk to her on TUESDAY and she confirms they are going to pay me.  Last night, hubby comes home and tells me when he called the bank only one week of pay had been deposited.  My temper immediately flairs and now I can\\'t sleep.  I arrive at work and, lo and behold, Ms R has left a message on my voice mail for me to call her at 8am.  I call at 8:02am...Mr R answers.  She tells me she is calling about my vacation pay...to which I say, yes, I figured as I know it was not deposited yesterday.  Ms R: Please let me finish what I have to say before responding.  Well, these rocket scientists did not understand their own frickin\\' policy.  SUPPOSEDLY, my vacation cannot be paid out until September (after my anniversary date)...BUT since it was their error, they will be paying out next week.  Very lucky...she tacks on, but next year we won\\'t be able to pay out until after your anniversary date.  To which I say, I pray to god I won\\'t be working for any of you next year.  For some reason, she seems shocked I said that...  While I have the brain-child on the phone I say, so what\\'s going on with my raise (thinking to self, you know, the one you all have screwed me out of for two years)...Ms R: I haven\\'t heard, I will call today.  Great let me know.  Side note:  I requested this raise the same day I talked to her about being screwed out of my vacation time...something in effect was said, you haven\\'t given me a raise for two years and now you are trying to steal my vacation too?!  Why haven\\'t you received a raise?  Because YOU told me not to request one two years ago.  Oh, well that hold was taken off a year ago...  Then WHY did you not tell me or why didn\\'t YOU initiate the raises I missed.  I decided to call someone here to see if they have even gotten the paperwork as my manager has been telling me he has yet to see anything.  She tells me she wouldn\\'t necessarily see it but it would go through Manpower and to call them...yes, I forgot to mention, I have recently been SUBCONTRACTED...so I call her, she tells me she received the request a week ago (What was the hold-up with PeopleLink that it took a month to get to them???) and that she cannot request until I have been approved to work the month of August...oh yeah, I am also now on a month to month...so that would be the end of July at the earliest!!!  I was SOOOOO irate by this point...I basically told her I would be hitting my knees more often and praying a lot harder that I would get out of this insane triangle.  Yeah, she didn\\'t like that too much either.  Then I called the area manager of my company.  She was not in so I asked for the name of the branch manager of the home office.  I called and talked to her.  She was well aware of the whole vacation screw-up and apologized for that...I proceeded to tell her the cluster about my raise.  She was surprised and had not heard anything about it and promised to contact Manpower and try to get the paperwork moved.  The ironic part?  I don\\'t even KNOW what they are asking...so I could be getting my panties in a bunch about .25!    the test was negative...not much emotion there...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nwell, I have the test.  I don\\'t know if I will do it tonight or try to hold out until Friday...although, I am pretty busy tonight so maybe that will hold my attention.  \"Working Mother\" magazine has an article this month about 2nd time around infertility.  I didn\\'t realize until I read the article how common this problem has become.  It really was a well written article, unlike others I have read about PCOS.  It talked about how heartbreaking it is and it said something to the effect, these women know exactly what they are missing out on, unlike women who don\\'t have any children.  Well, yes, exactly.  Not that infertility is any less of a heartache because they don\\'t know exactly what they are missing but women who don\\'t have any will look at someone like me and say, you should be happy you have at least one.  True, and I am very grateful.  However, you don\\'t have a small child begging for a brother or sister either.  Of all the cruel, insane comments I have had to deal with, B\\'s hit me right in the heart.  I can\\'t explain to a four year old why when I don\\'t know why.  I tell him this is how God wanted our family.  To which he responds, then I will pray for him to give me a sister/brother.  Anyway, I just greatly appreciated the article and wrote the editor to tell her so.  On a funny note, we went to Perkins (yuck!) for breakfast with my parents and younger sister.  This family walked in and was about ten people.  B\\'s eyes got big and said, their family goes on forever!  It was cute...  Countdown: 3 more days until departure.  Still have to clean the house.  Shop.  Pack.  Leave sister information.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nhmmm...still no period.  I could have SWORN I would start this weekend...I had such hideous pain in the netherregion.  I should get a hpt but then, I hate the idea of spending the money when I know I'm not.  I have decided to wait until Friday.  I have to know for the cruise since I am sure I will consume a few adult beverages.  We went suit shopping for hubby...his last suit was bought for his college graduation and was a bit snug.  hey, at least he could get the pants on and fastened...I couldn't even get my left leg in my college clothes!  Anyway, we went to JCPenney.  He went to the salesman and said, I need your cheapest suit.  Dude said, $200 is the cheapest.  Neither of us was thrilled...my main beef?  I see suits right next to you that say $169.99.  So, basically, I was onto the fact he was only about the sale.  So, finally, after looking around and being bothered by him, I said, let's go...I'll figure something else out.  As we are walking out, my eagle eye caught a clearance rack.  So, yeah, we found a suit and paid $65 after final markdowns...unbelievable!  Of course, hubby was just laughing.  He says, that guy should have KNOWN better than to mess with you and your nose for a sale...haha!  It wouldn't have been either of our first choices but it is for one night and it will look great...plus, he now has a suit that fits properly...  Other than that...trying to build up energy so I can clean the house before we leave.  Who likes to come home to a messy house?    btw...check out the helpmebubby blog...very cool\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nhey, fellow blogging friends!  This guy wants to know why we blog:  urlLink http://ydoublog.blogspot.com/2004/08/why-do-people-blog.html  so go forth and answer his question:)  I am in a giddy type mood...I think it is the sugar from the Gatorade I have been sipping on all day.  I decided since I can\\'t find an awesome gift for my sis, she is stuck with maternity clothes.  Lame-o, I know.  We talked today...she is stressing out because of her size.  I told her, please, do NOT obsess!  Every woman is so different...every pregnancy is so different.  She is so concerned because she knows I didn\\'t start showing until 6months...umm, yeah, but remember me at the end???  Plus, she is significantly shorter than I am, that makes a big difference too!!!  Not much else.  I decided I will be knitting her a baby blanket for the shower in October.  I found a pattern that is pretty cute and looks easy...we\\'ll see.  I haven\\'t picked up the needles for quite some time!  I went to a yarn store yesterday and was asking an opinion of one of the ladies that works there...big mistake.  This store has always had a stuck-up attitude...I have knit for so long and I will grace you with my knowledge but there is no other way than mine.  So, basically, she told me idea was stupid and she didn\\'t know (and I quote) \"what is in young mother\\'s heads these days...\"  Wow...let me put back the $40+ worth of yarn I have and relieve you from having such an ignoramous in your blessed presence.  So, I will go to the other yarn store that I really do like much better...I just was in the neighborhood of the other.  I will laugh if the lady ends up right...haha!  That would teach me!   Basically, I just want to add a \"fancy\" yarn in with the plain yarn on the smaller sections...oh, it is too difficult to explain...if there are knitters out there, let me know, and I will attempt to explain.  Her contention was that the baby would chew on the fancy yarn...okay, one of the yarns I picked out was like the whisper yarn, the kind with the longer \"hair\" strands...but the other was eros or something like that...it just has color blocks in it, nothing would actually stick out.  Anyway, my mom, who does not knit, says she thinks I should do it.  She said everyone always loves the \"creations\" I do so why should this be any different?  I\\'ll see what yarn I find today.\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nokay...this weekend, hubby and I watched \"Bowling for Columbine.\"  If you haven\\'t seen it, watch it.  It doesn\\'t matter if you are democrat, republican, or otherwise.  It was extremely interesting and shed light on many things...whether you believe them or not.  It raised very pointed questions and didn\\'t necessarily provide answers.  Thought provoking.  Very glad I watched it, a little scary since these nuts showcased had some tie to Michigan, but very good.  Now, I don\\'t know if I have mentioned, but I have never voted.  Wait, I did vote, the first time I would have been eligible.  Not memorable as I didn\\'t know who I was voting for, I voted Republican since that was who my parents voted for.  Scary, I know.  Anyway, this year, I really feel I need to vote.  The problem?  I don\\'t know who to vote for.  I pretty much steer clear of politics.  Why you ask?  Because, I feel, all politicians lie.  They say what we want to hear and then do whatever they want once voted in.  I think Clinton did a lot to disenchant me...regardless, I think the US has some pretty serious issues...and the first place to fix them would be with our leaders.  So, basically, since spring, I have tried to find more information.  Do I want to vote to re-elect Bush?  Do I want to vote to kick him out?  See, I don\\'t see it as voting to put Kerry in.  As I mentioned, I think they all lie, so why would I WANT Kerry.  Right now, he is lying...I can\\'t tell you if he is good until he has served 4 years.  So, right now, I need to decide if I think Bush did a good job...please, feel free to comment away.  I\\'m very open minded.   People never believe that when someone says that.  Don\\'t get me wrong...on actual ISSUES, I have mucho opinions.  On actual people...not so much.  At the same time, I can\\'t broaden my horizons without being challenged.  I realize that my opinion today may not be the same as it is tomorrow.  IE, I used to think I should vote based on my moral beliefs (abortion).  Then I realized, this is so not a current issue for our government.  By voting for someone who is against abortion, I may be voting for someone who is ripping education and food out of inner-city children\\'s reach...and which is more important???  I don\\'t see Roe vs. Wade being overturned anytime soon, so I need to be more concerned with the children that are here and who is watching over them...  See?  I told you...I have many opinions but enjoy hearing others.  Diversity is to be embraced... sharing ideas is the only way to come up with one that might actually work...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nSo, Friday was B's surgery.  We had to check in at 6:30am!  We could tell B was a little nervous but he held up like a trooper.  The pre-op nurse was so cute...Ruth.  She had B help her with the machine to take his blood pressure and pulse readings.  She had an adorable accent and I don't think B could understand what she was saying most of the time.  They gave him a medication that reminded me of Staydol...I don't know what it was but it took his apprehensions away.  It was funny because he was trying to tell us stories and would forget what he was saying.  The anesthesiologist came in and explained what he would be doing.  He told us B would experience discomfort/pain from the tube put down his throat.  The dr came in and we again asked what type of pain B would have...oh, there is no pain associated!  I asked her how she was going to remove the adenoids (through the mouth) because B had wanted to know.  They came and took him.  Hubby and I were only in the waiting room 30-40 minutes before the dr came back out and said she was done.  B's adenoids were significantly larger than in the CAT scan from March so the dr is convinced this was the problem and the removal will solve his issues.  Again, we asked what pain we could expect...oh, none!  The nurse came to get us a few minutes later and showed us to the recovery room.  B was sitting in a chair whimpering.  I asked the nurse what was wrong (naively believing he would not be in pain).  She explained boys' testosterone and the anesthesia don't mix and they wake up upset.  Hubby picked B up so I could put him on my lap and rock.  The moment he realized we were there he started shrieking...and shrieking...and sobbing...and shrieking.  It was awful.  I was not prepared for that (did anyone mention this would happen after asking a million times???)!  Meanwhile, the nurses are telling me I have to watch the IV flow...the faster he gets the fluid in him, the faster we go home.  Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, they came in to give him a sedative in his IV.  Well, the first one did nothing.  So a few minutes later, they were back with another one.  He stopped shrieking and just cried.  He said his throat hurt really bad.  So, we started giving him water.  He downed it like he was parched and ate a popsicle.  A nurse came in and warned us, the more water you give him, the more likely he is to vomit before you get home.  I guess the anesthesia throws off the equilibrium and having so much water in the stomach adds to it.  So what do we do?  She advised us if it keeps him calm, just give it to him.  I thanked her for the advance warning...I would MUCH rather know what I potentially face and prepare for it than be caught off guard (ie, not being forewarned how he would potentially be when he woke up!!!).  Thankfully, no vomiting...we got home, put him on the sofa bed and turned on cartoons.  Seriously, within an hour he was up and moving around.  By the end of the morning, he was bouncing off the walls and you would never know the child had surgery.  Great, excellent, blessing...yes.  BUT hubby and I had been told he was going to be groggy and tired so he would probably sleep all day.  So WE were expecting to be able to sleep all day...man!  I am so thankful he came through okay...of course, the night before, I had hideous nightmares and got virtually no sleep.  And, yes, I really am grateful that he is back to my rambunctious B.  B and I went to Kohl's on Sunday...they had a Superman tshirt on sale that hubby has been looking for to match his tattoo...who do we see?  Mr X's mom and stepdad...lordy.  I got my hair chopped off on Saturday morning and have yet to figure out how to style it so I am praying they did not see me!  Does anyone know of any awesome hair straightening products?  My haircut has reminded me why I don't do short...my hair is naturally funky wave and without the weight of long hair it goes crazy...ugh.  For example, I straightened and flipped this morning.  It is already wavy again!!!  I know my hair will take a while to re-train to flip but the wave is nasty...any advice is appreciated!\\n\\n\""
