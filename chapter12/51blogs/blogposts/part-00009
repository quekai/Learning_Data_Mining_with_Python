This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something.

At Lowes I'm going to check out lights and perhaps price out a home-grown light kit for some short movie projects that could get underway in the next month or so. Best Buy because I want to look at TVs. I will probably buy the next volume of The Family Guy on DVD while I'm there. But I won't commit to buying it so I won't think about how I'm spending all my earnings.  Last weekend I bought some Ray Bans with polarized lenses. They were expensive. I normally buy cheap sunglasses ($10 or less), but I was drawn to spending $100 on a pair of Ray Bans. They are so worth their cost. I've never had a pair of sunglasses this sturdy or that made my vision better in daylight. They are such an indulgence, but they are like the BMW of sunglasses.

"male"	"'\\n\\n\\n1. My eyes  2. No ceiling fans upstairs/no second floor air circulation  3. My stomach (feels like a bowlful of jelly).  So my eyes are bothering me a lot because I have a contacts prescription that is set to not sacrifice my proximate vision for perfect distance vision. So I can read while wearing my contacts, but my distance vision isn\\'t perfect. Everything within at least 20ft was in focus. Or so it was until recently, when I noticed that things start getting a bit fuzzy just past 4 feet, and my distance vision is worse. Now I remember two different optometrists recommending going for perfect distance vision, then having reading glasses. The first time this was recommended was while I was in school, and I wanted to be able to read the board and my textbook without glasses. So we compromised on the prescription. Since then my eyes have gotten worse (-7.00 diopters on each eye). I was already in the range where they don\\'t make contacts in .25 diopters of each other, so this is an approximation before taking the adjustment to maintain good proximate sight. Things being what they are now, I should go back to the optometrist (it\\'s only been about 6 months) and get reading glasses and contacts for distance. Of course this would mean wearing glasses most of the day (who doesn\\'t need their proximate vision 90% of the time anyway?). Or perhaps going the other way and having driving glasses. But that would leave me blurry when I\\'m looking afar (how far would have to be determined). The moral of the story is that I\\'m slowly but determinedly going blind. I mean, it\\'s all downhill from here. I don\\'t think laser eye surgery would work for me since my eyes are still changing (hence worsening sight). What can I do but lose more and more of my sight until I just see fuzzy blobs of color even with the strongest of optic assistance. I\\'ve been wearing some form of corrective lenses since elementary school. I was told there should be a point where my vision would stabilize. I could live with that. But no, I have to think about bifocal solutions at the age of 23.  Oh, and it\\'s warm up here. I changed the overhead bulb to a Compact Fluorescent, and it doesn\\'t get as hot up here as it had pre-CFL, but it\\'s still warm. And there\\'s no ceiling fan.

"male"	"'\\n\\n\\nI really tried to resist responding to  urlLink this thread .  [rant suppressed]  Okay, yeah. I have some major disagreements with the whole thread, but I won\\'t delve into it other than to say: The RNC hasn\\'t represented the values of their working class constituents for decades, if not the entire last century. The Republican Party has not been about smaller government or lower taxes in a very long time. Anyone interested in fiscal responsibility and efficient government would best be represented by the Democrats, or (if you still don\\'t realize that Democrats balance budgets and create jobs and wealth) perhaps the Libertarians (who seem to actually want to shrink government). I had written a long explanation, but decided not to turn this into an essay. Reagan=weak economy, higher taxes (he repealed the tax cuts he made early in his first term), Bush the elder=weak economy, higher taxes, Bush the lesser=tax burden shifted to the states by cutting federal support (that\\'s Dubya\\'s tax cut in a nutshell), weakest economy since the Depression. Clinton=two terms of the strongest economy America had since WWII, your taxes were used efficiently to create that.  So I only sort of suppressed the rant. I just hope people think about when they were well off and could get ahead, and when they have been scraping by. That\\'s what people need to think about for this next election.  Also, I liked the speeches at the convention. You may have missed great ones from John Edwards, Barack Obama, Ted Kennedy, and others. And about the slogans: I think Kerry using \"hope is on the way\" or \"help is on the way\" makes sense. When Bush was saying it in 2000, it meant little. After all, America was doing well. Apparently Bush was talking to his aristocratic friends, telling them he was about to screw the middle class in order to increase the gap between the elite and the working American. Kerry and Edwards are bringing hope, and help, to the backbone of America, the great masses who work hard every day. I thought the message of hope and unity is important in a time when the current administration promotes fear and suspicion at home. It sounds corny, but it\\'s believable. Bush failed to create a better America, but he surely did a lot to tear it down. Edwards and Kerry spoke the way they did to remind people that the government can be a great force for good when the right people are in the White House.\\n\\n\\n'"

You know, it's been a while since anyone smiled politely at me. Anyway, I think I've been too reclusive lately. I made writing a priority, but maybe I've taken it too far. I barely speak to anyone. Haven't made an effort to see friends, family, or acquaintances recently. I guess it's good they still call  me . Oh, yeah. I didn't even say hello to the girl.  I'm going to vote in the  urlLink NC primary  today, then go see  urlLink I, Robot .      Note: I almost lost this post in the publishing phantom zone. I also forgot to give it a title.\\n\\n\\n\""

"male"	"\"\\n\\n\\nBriefly: I went to a friend's thirtieth birthday party last weekend, and all his friends (including myself) spent a good amount of time arguing with my friend's dad about John Kerry. He thought it was odd that Kerry has spent so much time talking about his military background, and as a former soldier, he didn't think military service meant a good commander-in-chief. I wanted to make the point that Kerry had to prove his toughness, since Republicans have always tried to portray Democrats as anti-military and weak (on crime, unwilling to fight). It would have been a huge issue this election if the Dems had a candidate who hadn't served because the RNC would say that in times of war we need a war president (never mind Bush went AWOL for three months). Anyway, didn't have a chance to point that out at the time. Anyway, everyone was friendly afterwards, and the cake was good.  The weather! These past two days have been gorgeous. I think it may have something to do with Hurricane Alex. The weather in Wilmington was always very mild after a hurricane, but I think some of that made it up here. It's warm, with a nice cool breeze, clear skies. I need to be outside, so I'm going to find something to do.\\n\\n\\n\""
