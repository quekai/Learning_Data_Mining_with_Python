This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project.

"male"	"'\\n\\nHere is a small collection of some words translated from conventional insurance language into Malay which are found in the Takaful manuals sold by TNSB. Some of them are quite weird...and you have been warned.  Underwriting = Pengunderaitan *  Proper Advice Practices = Amalan Nasihat Berpatutan Financial Risk = Risiko Kewangan Non-Financial Risk - Risiko Bukan Kewangan Annuity = Anuiti   *  I am still not sure about this translation and I do not think it is correct. Care to comment?\\n\\n'"
"male"	"'\\n\\nSome of you may ask, what the heck is \"takaful\"? Well, to simplify matters, \"takaful\" is simply another way of operating the conventional insurance system you are familiar with. In other words, \"takaful\" is simply a concept for distributing money to participants if any untoward accidents such as fire, accidents, critical illness, etc. afflicts the participant of a particular takaful product. In other words, not much difference from the conventional system.  But what\\'s the difference, you may ask? Simple. The concept of Takaful does not contain elements in a conventional insurance system that renders it forbidden from the Islamic point of view. Takaful does not contain gharar, it does not contain maisir and it does not contain riba\\'. These elements are present in the conventional insurance system, which is why conventional insurance is considered forbidden. That does not mean, however, that only Muslims can enter the Takaful scheme. I have seen non-Muslims taking our products and they have praised our system which is far superior than the conventional insurance companies.\\n\\n'"
"male"	"\"\\n\\nGreetings to all and welcome to Takaful Guy's blog!  For starters, let me introduce myself: I am a Takaful agent selling  urlLink Takaful Nasional  products. I am actually a part time student but I sell TN products in my spare time and helping out my dad who is a Takaful Nasional agent too. To date Takaful Nasional's assets number at 2.8 billion ringgit, making us the strongest Takaful company amongst all the current takaful companies which include  urlLink Takaful Malaysia ,  urlLink Takaful Ikhlas  and Takaful Maybank.  I hope that this explanation suffices for now.  Anyway the reason I started this blog is to explain the Takaful concept with the public and perhaps let in some important info in the industry. I will also be airing some incidents I have had with customers in the past and express my views on them. Insha'allah I hope you will find my blog useful :)\\n\\n\""
