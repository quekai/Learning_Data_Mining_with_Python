This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.

"female"	"\"\\n\\nMr X called...so unexpected!  I thought I was in for a looong wait...but he had left a message on my voicemail that I got this morning.  So, of course, I held off until mid-morning and then returned the phone call--can't seem to excited...he said that I took him off guard with the last conversation and he hadn't really known what to say.  He said it kinda freaked him out...okay, I couldn't bring myself to ask what it was that freaked him out--not really sure, but I think he read way too much into my thoughts and questions...  He feels that I need to realize that I am remembering the past and that so much has changed since then...but no matter what, I need to let go of the past because that will never be.  He also said that he wished he could help me figure out why I wasn't happy because that is what he wished for me...that was sweet.  He said that he will support me no matter what I do but that I really need to take some time to think everything through...he wants me to be sure that I do it for me and not out of spite or emotions.  Ah, what age has done for Mr Xs maturity!  Of course, I had to call my voice of reality...she laughed and said it really did sound like we had role-reversed...haha, what a crack-up, my dear!    I think I need some time to digest everything...afterall, the big move is coming up and that is sure to bring so more emotions to the surface...\\n\\n\""

Awesome weekend...I went to see my roommate in Chi-town...she shipped off her hubby and bubs so we had the night to ourselves...IKEA here we come!!! We tried to remember that our husbands would kill us if we brought home one of everything:)  We had a rip-roaring time at Houlihan\\'s and then went to find the nearest tattoo parlor...the funny thing was, there was some SHADY business next door...hmm....not drawing any conclusions but what do you think with lots of doors and an ATM??? Of course, I had to use the bathroom as soon as we get there...the place smelled HIDEOUS!!! But, using their restroom was worse then squatting against a tree in the African Rainforest...I felt seriously violated and thank god I had spare kleenex--hello, toilet paper!  It was just like old times...we even watched our party videos...boy, were we off the hook back then!!! A little embarassing but mostly just HALARIOUS!  It was great re-visiting Tow-truck Mike, Joe, John...George--I mean Kevin...sigma-kappa...and Kelly...  Hubby was a downer when I got home...he was CRABBY...so we had a huge blowout...ah, wonderful way to cap off the weekend!  I talked to Mr X again Sunday night...it was funny calling because I had wanted to suggest we see each other at some point but didn\\'t have the balls.  So I was just like \"um, yeah, hi, uh-hu\"--DORK!!!  I think it made him crack up though:)  Just talked about what\\'s new and then got into a deep discussion on happiness and to what extent someone is free to chase it down...but his phone kept cutting out and I was sick of calling back...so I didn\\'t.  But I KNOW he has my phone number...he said he had lost it before--uh-huh, sure--so I gave it to him AGAIN...let\\'s see if he ever actually calls...still holding out for my bd.\\n\\n'"

Okay...what has been making my brain do crunches...I talked to Mr X about three-four weeks ago...for a LONG time.  It was very nice actually...however, since then, I have an undying urge to call him again.  I did call back once to let him know the (fake) reason for my original call was now void due to an unforeseen (also, fake!) emergency...ah, revisiting the jr high days can be so freeing!... alas, X was not home and I was only able to communicate with the answering machine.  I was hoping I would receive a return call just to say--hey, I really enjoyed talking with you...I\\'ve missed you and I wish you well...  Now, I am holding onto the hope that I will receive a message for the dreaded \"B\" that is rapidly approaching...  Time to psychoanalyze....I have come to the conclusion that I am mortified of commitment...rather humorous looking the commitment level in my life I know...  But I have a tendency to get myself WAY over my head (with commitments) and then start pushing them all away...so, is this another passive aggressive way to kill-off my current commitments?

When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I    .  am defined as a bitch.

It means I have the courage and  strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won\\'t become anyone else\\'s idea   of what they think I \"should\" be.   I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!

"female"	"'\\n\\nWhew! what a weekend...and not in a good way...  My \"voice of reason\" called...I told her my decision about not calling Mr. X again...I told her I came to realize it would be the same old thing and no point...and she says \"so basically you just wanted to make sure he still wants you and then ditch him...\" ah...no!  I needed to finally feel closure on a very tumoltuous time in my life and talking about it with him was the last resort...I have been through YEARS of therapy and nothing ever closed that door and I finally feel that it is slowly starting to swing shut...ugh! whatever!  Scott and I actually had a pretty good weekend...we worked together all day Saturday to get the rest of our stuff organized and did a HUMONGO cleaning...I cleaned our little bathroom for an hour and a half!!! I found some nasty scum that I will spare you the details about...but it made me want to heave!  Ah...then the infamous Sunday...thinking I was a good dooby going to dinner at the parents to spend some quality time with my sis that never keeps in touch...and my matriarch decides this would be a good day for an all-out attack...apparently, my sis mirrors the other picture of perfection in the fam and spilled some beans found out to my parents about the other sis that mirrors my picture of total and utter imperfection...so, of course, my mom thinks that I am to blame...I am the original black sheep, you know...and heaven forbid, this sis could actually be making decisions on her own...NO...it is MY fault because I tried to look out for them and teach them things about the world that my parents would like to naively believe would never be experienced--except that now that I have talked with them about it, they are destined to experiment--because they would have never come across it otherwise!  Ahhh...then, mommy-dearest decides to start in about our past...to which I must have started to flip out because Scott was trying to corral me into a different room...not that I would have attacked her, but it did cross my mind...  Okay...first of all, my parents can never quite make up their minds what they think should be done...it is basically up to the whim of my mother\\'s emotions, which change constantly...  Secondly, let\\'s move on!  I didn\\'t go through all of this therapy to be pushed right back where I was...I am an ADULT...and, quite frankly, I can talk to my sister\\'s about anything I DAMN PLEASE!!!  I don\\'t want them driving drunk, or being taken advantage of, and never having taken the opportunity to discuss these things with them...that would be guilt...not my mum trying to blame what she sees as evil on me...always looking for someone else, never looking within...  Thirdly, my sis does need to realize things about life...but I am living proof that having someone breathing fire down your back is swimming against the current...it can\\'t happen until she is allowed to explore herself.  I feel bad for her because she was caught in the crossfire...and part of it was about her and alot of it wasn\\'t...  Mum did come back and apologize--and after they revived me, her and my dad said how much they wanted to talk with me about what I \"went through\" so that they could understand...and to that I said, like hell!!!  Please...really, guys, I love you, I forgave you, but you can\\'t slap me and call me stupid anymore!!!  For YEARS, I wanted to explain this to them and make them see...if for no other reason than to prevent it from re-occurring with my sisters, which it has...but the don\\'t want to know...they want to believe they have had no part.  And that\\'s their choice, but I don\\'t need to put myself back in the place of being rejected and ridiculed...

I must have been in one of my \"bitch can\\'t stop me\" moods because I asked him what it was that freaked him out.  He said that I had been talking about all these thoughts and that he just didn\\'t want me to get over my head without being realistic...i laughed--hehe--how\\'s that for a blow to the ego--and told him that I think he misunderstood what I had said and that I never meant to propose anything because that was FAR from where I was at...had I thought about it?  yeah...sadly, so...however, i may be f#@*ed up but I am not that far gone...well, after I said that he wanted to get off the phone and told me to call him any time...I said \"please feel free to do the same\" and left it at that...so, basically, I am going to leave it there...I came, I heard, and I walked away...I know what is there and I have to believe there was a reason I had walked away before and I need to release myself from that...whew...what a revelation!  Too bad I couldn\\'t have come to that conclusion before I started down such an idiotic path!  I am just very thankful that in all of that I chose not to go the step further to see him...that would have been jumping right into the fire...

But of course, my husband, who is oh so understanding, helped me with the packing...oh, wait, not MY husband...he would just keep looking around and say, what is it that needs to be packed...uh, HELLO!!! see this *@#! all over...all THAT needs to be packed...he just doesn't get it and continues to choose to be ignorant...and it is getting VERY old!

Ass...big, fat, hairy, horse's ass, would be the correct way of stating it!  He said that he didn't have time...because, oh yeah i forgot, he worked SOOO hard on packing...whatever!!!

We talked for 20minutes about nothing...I have nothing to say!  What do I say...um, I was really screwed up and needed some closure so I could finally stop thinking about you...well, I got it and now I wish you would stop calling me?!  I don't know if I can tell him that.  And not because I want to stay in contact, but because I don't want to hurt his feelings AND I don't want to promote any psychoticness...he is all about that he has changed, and part of me wants to believe that, but the other part sure doesn't want to pay the penalty if I'm wrong!

He finally let me get off the phone, and said...I'll call you soon...and then said, wait maybe you should call me...I just said I'll talk to you later...

So how ironic that this morning I would come in to a message from Mr X asking me to call...so I did, no hard feelings, just no smooshy feelings either...he obviously wanted to talk but I had absolutely nothing to say...he told me he passed his test to be a truck driver so now he is looking for a new job...I almost busted out laughing...not that there is anything wrong with truck drivers...they deliver the goods that I buy...but, to have thought he was what I truly wanted and screwed up...whew, what a momentary lapse of sanity!

Smaller size a little snug, bigger size a little big.  But I went clothes shopping and can totally fit into the small size--yeah!  On my weigh to my old self!  If I get to a 10 I will be happy, though I would love to get back to 8 since I have so many cute clothes from that era:)  I gave up on the 6...selling all that in my garage sale.

I am the queen of thrift...I can\\'t bring myself to pay alot of money for furniture...especially with a toddler--boy!  We demolished our last couch in under three years, so until I can get the B-meister to sit instead of climb (maybe by 20!) it will be thrifty furniture for me!  Anyway...we bought it at big lots--odd lots...wonderful name!

"female"	"'\\n\\nWow...what a week and a half!!!  I got a call from an old friend...the type of friend that will always hold a special place in your heart, but isn\\'t really a true friend.  I have known her for as long as I can remember...we basically grew up together.  She just doesn\\'t know what it takes to be a good friend.  She will be there for you when it is convenient and when she is not busy with a boy.  It has caused a lot of pain and frustration but I know that people like that are truly the ones that lose.     Anyway, she called and left a message that she just HAD to talk to me.  So, of course, I assumed she was engaged (again) since this is really the only time she wants to talk to me...so I called back.  Boy, was I blown away!  No, she did not get engaged, she got married!!!  Okay, to say that I was shocked would be a major understatement!  All I could say was \"wow, congratulations\"...hmm... She told me that no she wasn\\'t pregnant...she assumed that this is what I thought--not so!  I just didn\\'t know what to say...I don\\'t really even know him so I can be happy she is happy and pray that it lasts...  Then, I have been trying to get ahold of one of my best friends...his number was disconnected, so I called his brother.  Now, he was dating a girl who just had a baby--not his--and his brother thought it would be funny to tell me he had gotten married...please, my heart can\\'t take it right now!  But no...he just up and went to TX.  Not sure why and not sure for how long.  His brother said he doesn\\'t have a number to reach him...he didn\\'t come back for his sister\\'s wedding...kinda concerns me, that doesn\\'t sound like him.  He was so excited to come for a visit...but hopefully he has email for when I get off my lazy bum and write:)  That\\'s enough drama for now:)\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nhmmm...so much for being back in a few!  I am beginning to think I have an anti-social personality disorder.  I don\\'t like being around people!  I would much rather prefer to stay at home, relaxing by myself than to be around \"friends\"...and this is another issue, why is it that I always push away those that reciprocate friendship and draw near to those who suck the life out of me?!  I think that I don\\'t want people to know \"me\" and so I only keep those around who minimally acknowledge my existence...why?  I hate to say this, but that is how my family has always been.  Not that I am jumping into the \"I blame mom and dad for all my short-comings/problems\" but I really don\\'t think that they know who I am...quite honestly, they choose not to.  I can\\'t tell you how many times I tried to let them in...desperately, but they can\\'t handle it.  Ultimately, I feel like there is something morbidly wrong that causes people a) to not want to get to know me or b)to run as soon as they get a glimpse.  Therefore, I don\\'t enjoy being hurt, so I keep those who would be kind at an arm\\'s length distance and pull closer the ones that just use me anyway...  Case in point...my maid of honor.  Why?  That is all I can say!  She has never been and never will be a true friend, yet I continue to knock myself out for her.  After this shower, I\\'m done...not that I won\\'t talk or do lunch with her, but I am done beyond that...  It just is kind of a bummer when I sit back and think of all the true friends I\\'ve shut out and the fact that I don\\'t really have any in town.  One of my bf called to wish me a happy mother\\'s day, I just started balling...she moved to IN and I miss her alot!  I never fully explained everything to her, but I never felt that it caused a growth defect in our friendship either.  When she left, I was VERY removed...in fact, I still haven\\'t returned her call...I\\'m a bum...my other bf lives in TX...yeah, that\\'s a hike!  But we have the best time on the phone, I just wish I could see her every once in a while!  anyway...enough wallowing in self-pity...  Not much else is new...the hubby about killed me because I spent $300-400 this weekend...I decided I was going to finish buying the \"big\" items for the house...and, oops, I forgot a couple things.  They will HAVE TO wait...I seriously think he will suffocate me in my sleep if I spend any more!  No Mr X...hmmm, wish I would have been the last to call, now I feel like an ass...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nYeah...i\\'ve been procrastinating...  Okay...yesterday, I had to go to the \"Project Engineering Admin\" meeting...one word...BORING!!! Can we all feed more into the admin-bitch persona????  I just sat and looked around and said...uh, hell, no!!!  I will NOT do this for much longer.  Once the B-meister is in school, I will be doing something that feeds my soul, not something that is rapidly sucking my soul out of me!  Ugh...admins suck major dookie!  Stupid job, stupid power trips...personally, I hate admins...they always think higher of themselves than they are...like, come on, it doesn\\'t take a genious to do what we do...we are basically white trash slaves...overworked, underpaid, and too stupid to do anything about it!  Not sure what I am going to do...I have been majorly fantasizing...I would love to do something artsy...but I am afraid it wouldn\\'t be fun anymore...kinda like when I made all the Christmas presents and wanted to puke for the next 4months whenever I thought of doing anything crafty...  ahh...now that I have that off my chest...i did break down and call Mr X.  It was kinda weird...i used to think i had this premonition thing...whenever something huge was about to happen (usually bad) that I wouldn\\'t have any way of knowing about...I would get these mini panic attacks...it was weird and freaked me out so I eventually stopped paying attention to those feelings...anyway, all that to say...B-meister and I were on our way to MI City to hit the Pfaltzgraff outlet when I had this insane feeling that I was about to run into Mike.  Which then got me thinking about what I would do...say...die of embarassment from the way I looked...you know, normal obsessions...after about five minutes, I was approaching the overpass by Benton Harbor and low and behold the Mr B\\'s truck passed over it as I was going under...I about crapped my pants!!!  Needless to say, I had to call him the next day to see if it was him...he said nope, he was on his way to MI City!!!  WEIRD!!!  I still am kinda freaked out about it...  gotta take a break...be back in a few...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nI was having some very vivid, very real dreams...so I have been researching online the meaning of dreams...here is some of what I found:  Unconscious material attempting to make itself known, especially knowledge that you\\'ve feared. Look to the qualities of the intruder for more awareness about your fears. It may also represent aspects of yourself that you\\'ve denied  If the separation/divorce is an old one, the presence of the ex, especially in a positive way, may remind you that this is a quality you need to incorporate into your present life/relationship. The dream could be suggesting that what you learned from a previous relationship may need to be applied in a present one; that you\\'re repeating the same mistake; that feelings/attitudes you have about an ex (especially as they apply to men/women in general) are being transferred onto a present relationship. What part of you is an \"ex,\" or is some part of you being \"x\\'d out\"?\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nOkay...back to epiphanes...and, no, i still don\\'t know if i am spelling it correctly...  The other major shortage in my life was/is physical affection.  There were some things that happened in my mother\\'s life, which she says totally effected the way she is able to show affection.  She said that she also went through a period when my older sis and i were young that she did not feel comfortable with my dad giving us an abundance of affection.  They were both so hands off I just have always figured i wasn\\'t huggable turning into i wasn\\'t loveable.  I guess that I have always had all the pieces but i have never been able to step back and put the puzzle together.  Meanwhile, as I was growing up, I was trying to get affirmation and affection from anywhere i could.  This leads me to another revelation.  At some point in our relationship, mr x and i began to have sex...and my understanding of when this happened and his understanding were two very different timetables.  This really freaked me out when he told me this...and i never really understood what it meant.  At one point, through all of my counseling, i wondered if i was raped...but i didn\\'t really understand how i could have been and not known.  at this time, i really don\\'t think that i was.  for one, mr x was not like that.  i mean he has his faults, and temper/rage was one of them but never did he force himself on me and it wasn\\'t like we were drinking together--i never drank until i was almost 21--long after he was ditched!!!  i still don\\'t think i completely understand what this means.  but i really wonder if i blocked out when we actually had sex.  My reasoning?  I truly, truly, truly wanted to be a virgin when i got married.  not because my parents said i had to be, but because for some reason i really believe this is the best way...and, trust me, now i know why it is--unfortunately, i learned the hard way...but anyway...i think that i was so starving for affection that this beautiful guy who was the only one who listened to me and wanted to be with me all the time was interested in ME that i wanted to be so close to the one person in my life who wanted to be that to me...i ate it up and let it go as far as it did.  i think eventually i came to terms with the fact i was 1)having sex and 2)liking the feeling of being close (and the horomones) that i was okay with the fact i just threw my morals out the window.  then i was having sex all the time.  it was hard though...having to lie.  i think that is the first time in my life that i blatantly was living a double life.  but i knew the consequences if my parents found out and i wasn\\'t willing to deal...my god--they would have thrown me out, i\\'m sure!  my parents were always extremely hard on me...i don\\'t know why me, but it makes me laugh, hurt, and get pissed all at the same time when i see how laxidazical (again...sp???) they are with my sisters...who of course, think they are harsh...but if they could have walked a day in my shoes!!!  i also think that when things did go sour that in my mind i blew them way out of proportion...now, there were some shady incidents with bodily force being used...and there was the stalking thing...but i don\\'t really think that i was beat.  just misused.  again, not making excuses, there is no reason too...but i think mr x and i had an extremely volatile relationship...alot of which stemmed from the fact we were both so needy.  when it was good, it was awesome...when it was bad, it was hell...  i don\\'t know why it has been so important for me to come to grips with these incidents, but they have been playing in my mind alot lately...i think that i just have a desire to come to terms with my past so that i can go on in the present.  i don\\'t want to be a \"victim\"...so far, two HUGE pieces of the puzzle put together...i really don\\'t think i will ever reconcile the school thing...that is one that is still painful and i think this causes me to put blinders on...i can\\'t get past it...i can\\'t remember what happened and that is so frustrating!  and i don\\'t want to talk with my parents about it...  anyway...this really sounds a lot more depressing than it has felt.  it is such a huge relief to finally feel like i have some answers...it gives me back so many pieces of myself that i never really understood and didn\\'t know where they were hiding...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nwow...just was sent a really cool site... check it out!  Interviewwithgod.net  I liked a lot of the phrases:  \"You cannot make anyone love you~you can only learn to let yourself be loved...\" \"It is not enough to forgive one another but to forgive yourself\" \"There are many people out there who love you but have not learned how to show or express their feelings\"\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nWow...what a rollercoaster week...  I have been reading an anger management book at the request of our counselor.  And reading that, coupled with some soul searching, I have had many epiphanes (sp?) this week...i have really begun to see my adolescent to adult years in a new light.  I never have been able to explain to people why I hate myself...what happened that made me feel so unloveable...why i am into self-destruction...and why i am so angry at my parents.  I just \"knew\" that i have never felt accepted or loved by them.  Even though I knew that they always told me that they loved me...its the emotional unavailability.  My parents don\\'t want to go to a deep level when it is personal.  Sure, we talk about concepts, ideas, etc...which usually lead into arguments but we never talked seriously, cautiously about something that is effecting us on a personal level.  I was never able to open up to my parents for many reasons: judgement, punishment, and total avoidance.  Yep...that\\'s my parents.  They can\\'t accept that their kids might have faults without selfishishly turning the focus on themselves.  It always has to turn into...so you\\'re saying i did something to cause this, etc...you know, sometimes you just want to be able to actually talk about what you are feeling without having to defend something that you may not even completely understand yourself!!! I think this is a huge reason why it has taken me so long to figure this out.  They have me feeling so guilty about being angry at them that I have never had the opportunity to figure out what i am/was angry about!  I have been too busy trying to forgive and forget, yet not completely understanding what it is that i am busting my ass to forgive and forget!    Whew...which led me to my next epiphane...i am so ultra sensitive to rejection, criticism, etc that i am really fucking up my marriage.  Not that I am taking complete blame for our problems...but if scott does not do everything perfectly i get either depressed or upset...or if he voices an opinion i take it as him telling me i\\'m not good enough and that i need to change.  umm...okay, in some circumstances that could be true, but freedom of speech was lost somewhere...so i wrote scott a long letter explaining what i was working through and apologizing.  i told him i am seriously committing to changing this about me and that i wanted to accept his faults and ultimately, accept myself.  he wanted to talk about it, but i\\'m really not ready to.  it still is pretty open and raw and dangerous.  i think that ever since i can remember people have had this preconceived idea of what they needed me to be for them and i have busted my ass to comply.  My parents needed me to get perfect grades and be the perfect christian and be the right amount of popular, participate in extra curricular, etc...and i did this for a large majority of my life.  my friends are the same way...even my mr x was like this...and whenever i would fulfill this need i have always felt like i am dropped.  it\\'s not that anyone needs me as an individual, they need something from me, a shoulder to cry on, someone to fuck, a companion so that they aren\\'t alone..etc.  i think that scott was the first person who saw all of my faults and actually let me be me...not that he didn\\'t voice opinions but he has never tried to control me.  and to me, that is so abnormal that it has felt more like he didn\\'t care then he is actually the one loving me unconditionally.  so as i am realizing this, i am realizing what a disaster my life is because of me trying to sabotage everything.  i really think that i was trying to get him to leave because i wouldn\\'t do it...and now, to have a clean conscience and start anew...i am seriously considering telling him about mr x.  why? hmm..to make myself feel beter.  i feel guilty and it would help me \"come clean\"...however, is that the best thing to do?  maybe i should talk about it with my counselor.  egh!  talk about putting myself in front of the firing squad!  but, i don\\'t want to hurt scott and i don\\'t want to lie either.  who knows...i\\'ll think about it but it makes me want to barf.  more later...\\n\\n'"

We talked about the \"old\" days...i told him how i had found a couple boxes of jr high/high school stuff at my parents and how halarious it was.  And it truly felt like I was talking to an old friend from the past and once we hung up it was over...no pining, no wondering...yippee!!!  And the best part is I will never call him again and I won\\'t have been the last to call:)  anyway...b still has a temp but all else is fine...so I will take him to the dr tomorrow if he still has a temp but i really have no idea what it is from...  tt my bf...it was so awkward.  I don\\'t really know why but i didn\\'t feel comfortable talking to him and there were some definite barriers...could it be the lectures i was getting?  okay...when i said i had to watch my mouth because b mimics EVERYTHING  i meant i had to stop saying things like \"crap\" etc...the expletives have left my vocabulary a while ago, i\\'m not that stupid...ahh, another word that i need to stop using!  Anyway, got a two minute lecture about how if i can\\'t say it in front of b, should i be saying it at all???  hmmm...its not that i can\\'t say these things in front of him, however, i would prefer my son not to go around saying crap and stupid...thanks!  that was just one of several lectures and i sound more pissed (another one!) than i really am...just annoyed.  not at him, but at how the message was delivered...also sad that it seems we have gotten to a place we probably won\\'t come back from and i\\'m not sure how or why we are there.  then my other bf...seems like she\\'s avoiding...don\\'t know if she is but everytime i talk to her she has to get off the phone suddenly but promises to call back...she usually does a few days later but still...i don\\'t think we\\'ve had a good conversation in weeks...i think it is her whole mr x thing...she says there are absolutely no feelings toward him, only anger...but anger comes from hurt and hurt from openness...so it started from somewhere and maybe she has never had closure...her mr x got engaged and that has to be rough...i don\\'t know how i would feel.  but she told me before that she had successfully stuffed those thoughts until we started talking again, so maybe i\\'m the link and she is trying to forget...i haven\\'t even told her that i think i can come out this fall!!!  lots more to tell, but i have to work since i am leaving early today...\\n\\n'"

I have really missed talking to him, though i am very worried about the whole mr x thing...i don\\'t know yet if i will tell him because he will be far from thrilled...he\\'ll probably be mad, so i\\'ll wait to see what is going on in his life to see if it is even important enough to discuss.  it\\'s kinda funny how most of my friends are guys...i always thought that it was because i couldn\\'t make girlfriends but guys are a lot less maintenance, plus they don\\'t usually act catty like girls do.  i just don\\'t think that i like to disclose much to others, so i think i only let in a few at a time.  the only problem with that is that when one relationship is on the rocks it knocks out about half of my support system...  okay...so a new admin started yesterday and i had the opportunity to help train.  she was asking me about different people (admins) and i went into this whole spiel about how i don\\'t like to get caught up in the politics of offices...blah, blah, bla...so she says \"i\\'m the same way!\" and then rants for 10-15 min about who she does and doesn\\'t like...how do you know after 1 day?!  ugh, admins are an incorrigible bunch of weirdos!    got some cute lingerie for the get-away...now i\\'m debating a bikini wax...ouch!  but it beats shaving...i wonder if a home waxing system would work.  i also picked up some comfy pj\\'s and am considering any other fun gadgets...hmmm...not quite decided.  since the hubby isn\\'t too into funky i figured the lingerie will be enough for him:)  that\\'s all for now...toodles!\\n\\n'"

Especially when your hubby sucks at the affirmation part of life.  He is awesome with Brennan...he always affirms him... however, he seems to forget about me.  Now, understand, I don\\'t ask for a lot...I have never been one to demand my guy to give me presents, have a fortune, extravagant anything...and, why???  Because I have always KNOWN that I am high maintenance as far as the affirmation stands.  I seriously go nuts if I don\\'t get it.  I know that I am like a good 30lbs heavier...but I don\\'t think I have completely gone to the dogs.  I have really been trying to keep better care of myself.  I had kinda forgotten (not really) about that...I think I was depressed and let myself go a little too far.  So, I have been trying to get back on track.  But I have realized a few things...1) if the person you knock yourself out for doesn\\'t notice, what\\'s the point?  2) because you knock yourself out and that person doesn\\'t notice, it becomes more depressing and food looks more appealing.  which brings me to my other revelation...i\\'m an addict...not sure where it comes from, but I definitely am an addict...i am addicted to food and other things, but right now lets just talk about food.  i gorge myself all the time.  It is a serious struggle not to, which i don\\'t know why i try to stop myself, because when i finally give in, an hour, a day, a week later it is a thousand times worse than if I just gave in originally.  i don\\'t really think about anything while i do it...but i feel like shit afterwords.  i think i do it to deal with stress and to continue feeling like shit...if i didn\\'t hate myself, where would i be?  it\\'s kind of scary...like, everything else has miraculously come to some sort of order, but if i let go of this last demented thing, what will happen?  it\\'s hard to explain...i don\\'t think i even really understand it...i have such a distorted view of myself, the opinion changes constantly...  the thing that is humorous to me is that i used to be the opposite, i used to starve myself out of disgust...what the hell???  how on earth did i do that???  so i basically have only a few \"hopes\" as far as the weight loss goes...a) spastic colon kicks back into high gear...actually i need to go on a low fat diet to help that out...hmmm  b) i learn how to vomit more effectively...okay, i know that is disgusting.  however, it helped me get through some stressful times...i don\\'t know why, and it grosses me out and my hubby (who unfortunately walked in on me doing it).  I was just aching so badly that wretching over the toilet took my mind off it.  ughh...now you know why i gross myself out.  whenever my mom talks about how she doesn\\'t \"get\" why we do this to ourselves and how i \"got over it\" i just cringe...i really thought I was beyond it...i still do, that part of me does not reign, however, isn\\'t bingeing just as bad???  i do choose to be happy but it doesn\\'t mean i know how to cope any better.  so i still have my dark moments.\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nI really should have written this a long time ago, but it has been a crazy week...  So, we went to the 4th of July parade like hubby insisted...I really didn\\'t know what to expect.  I assume he remembers that is where I saw Mr X but neither of us have said anything about it, being the good little communicators that we are!  So, we parked at the High School parking lot and walked...hubby said that he was going to find us a great spot...in my head played the theme from Jaws...I tried not to be obvious when I let out a humongo sigh of relief when we passed Mr X\\'s Parents house...but I hadn\\'t released the whole sigh yet when hubby said \"how \\'bout here?\"  Okay...less than one house down from Mr X\\'s...ew.  And, of course, the direction the parade comes is the direction I have to look to see the house.  At first, I thought I was clear...I saw sister, grandpa, stepmom, and dadl but no Mr X..then it hits me...the guy in the hugely baggy shorts, ugly blue tshirt, and BALD man is Mr X!   Wow...what a year can do to a guy!  I tried to stifle my laugh...he is BALDING...and he looks like he has some disease because he is MUCH thinner than when we were dating.  Now, when we were dating, I was less than a 6 with pelvic bone and ribs sticking out and we would compete to see who had more pelvige...but he is way beyond that point...serioiusly, sickly.  Then I saw the new thang...old...bad perm up in a barrette and banana clip, bad bangs, worse glasses....short shorts--too much cellulite for me! and a halter top...now, I do not practice ageism...but unless you have a seriously rockin\\' bod...you should not be in a halter top!  Those were made for skinny girls with moderate bosoms.  No big hooters...no barely there...there is a specific body type that can get away with a halter and she was FAR BEYOND it!!!  So, that made me want to burst out even louder!  Ah...it really was good for my ego...  Alas, I settled down and enjoyed the parade with my balding hubby and son...so thankful I wasn\\'t about all that.  Then, I realize Mr X and sister are standing exactly opposite of me!  I really tried not to look up...very difficult, but I didn\\'t want to let on that I knew they were right there...I really don\\'t know why they were, unless they realized or thought it was me and was just verifying that fact.  But, I haven\\'t heard from him, so I don\\'t know if he saw me or not...Now, I dressed kinda cute, but not too obvious...my flare jeans and a pink tank top...the pink accentuates my tan:)  No, really I hate tank tops, but I have this evil multi-faceted tan going on and I knew it would be a primo opportunity to try to get it evened out...boy, would I like to know what the reaction was:)  But...I probably never will.  Hubby is really having a hard time with this whole thing...and he has every right to.  Counselor said a) I should\\'ve never done it (i would agree in theory) and b) I owed it to hubby to be honest a LOT sooner...again, I agree in theory.  Am I making excuses?  no...I 100% agree that I crossed the line.  However, the results were satisfactory for me and will help me in the long run...it is so hard to explain.  But...if I hadn\\'t called him, I would still be fantasizing about our \"life\" together and wishing it was over between my hubby and I ...plus, I have been able to get closure on a lot of questions and have been able to look at Mr X with the light of reality, not romanticizing it... as for point b...i think i would have done more damage to tell him in the midst of it that i was 2 minutes from walking out.  I would have had to deal with the counselor and hubby\\'s emotions/reactions and not been able to fully complete this.  Selfish? yeah, probably...but again, it allowed closure to an area I really didn\\'t think would ever see the grips of death, and now i can happily say its done.  hubby doesn\\'t believe that, and I really can\\'t blame him...its like a bad re-run.  but i have never had so much peace about this area...and there really are no more questions in my mind about what happened between mr x and i...  my bf is pissed i even said anything and said i was selfish to tell him.  then she said i should have told him after the first time if i was going to tell...hmm, she\\'s fucked up.  she continues to lie to her hubby and i think she just wants drama in my life to vicariously live through...sorry chicky!  I hate drama...i apologize this whole fiasco caused drama, but it was not my intent...i\\'ve been over that since college...maybe that\\'s her deal, she never went to college...now, I\\'m just being mean.  it just really disappointed me that she was so harsh and that it was so obvious that she wasn\\'t giving sound advice.  that really leaves me back at square one with no one to give me sound advice.  i guess that means i am stuck with therapy for the rest of my life?!  NO THANK YOU!  I am scared poopyless for the day I have to go to counseling to talk about this whole thing.  We went to ss yesterday and I SWEAR he changed the lesson once he saw me...that\\'s what we call Conviction (notice the capital C!!!)...  i\\'ll fill in the rest later...gotta work...yuck!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nTalk about hostility...  Yesterday, b had four of his friends come over to play outside...it was pretty funny.  at first, b was trying to run around to get his toys that they were playing with.  after the 100th time of telling him that if he didn\\'t share he would have to have a time out, he resolved that he would just have to make sure they new the toys were his...so he went around \"mommy that\\'s my truck\"  \"mommy that\\'s my car\"...to which i kept saying \"yes that\\'s your XXX, isn\\'t it fun sharing with XXX?\"  i don\\'t think he was convinced this was fun!  But it was so cute to watch a bunch of 21/2 year olds who are only children play but never really play together...they all had their own thing going on and occassionally they would acknowledge each other...like by splashing each other or trying to swipe a toy.  Hubby and I made nice I guess...I decided, be upset or forgive...ughhh...i chose to forgive.  So, I tried to stay awake to see him but wasn\\'t successful, so I just snuggled with him when he came to bed...hopefully, I didn\\'t drool considering I was still pretty much asleep.  Nervous about possibility of seeing mr x tomorrow.  Hubby decided he wanted to go to the richland parade...he knows i saw Mr X last year and i am hoping the reason he wants to go isn\\'t because he wants to hunt him down!  i don\\'t think he would do that...especially because of his career choice, here\\'s hoping!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nwhoops...and if I would have just told him what was written down below, I would have been in a lot better place than last night!  I decided to wait up for hubby...I honestly wanted to smooth things over...it is so hard to be without your husband during the week and only get to spend quality time together on the weekend...obviously I am the only one feeling this loneliness because he just doesn't put forth the effort...okay, that's not exactly fair, but the guy is so fucking melancholy about everything--it drives me crazy!!!  I did ask if that is what the deal was...is it because we got into a groove and he figured he could lax on his responsibility and we would be okay???  He had nothing...nothing to say except I am ornary...what did he expect?!!!  I get so tired of his overgeneralizations...all of sudden I am ALWAYS ornary and there has been NO change...hmmm, I said so basically you are calling yourself a liar...he didn't like that too much but I told him that is so contrary to what he has said in counseling and on our date that one of them had to be a lie!  Anyway...it was bad, got worse, and still isn't resolved...so we'll see if he actually calls today...bastard.\\n\\n\""
