The idea is to let users control the ad delivery, and even to allow users to comment on ads.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nurlLink GC-red   Revisar en detalle la propuesta de GC-red. Aparenta ser una comunidad interesante, dedicada a la formaci\u00f3n de gestores del conocimiento.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni have no idea what to put here\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreparing my Libraries orientation for graduate computer science students, and found this fascinating article on  urlLink  ACM Queue  vol. 1, no. 4 - June 2003 - \"How Much Storage is Enough?\"  : \"In 1999, the world produced about 1.5 exabytes of storable content (1018 bytes). This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.  D\u00e8s que j\\'ouvre la bouche, elle me rentre dedans.  Un peu comme hier quand je disais que \u00e7a ne me faisait rien que le recteur revienne, mais elle \u00e9tait s\u00fbre qu\\'il ne reviendrait jamais (wrong answer!)  Un autre exemple des erreurs de Mme Je sais tout?  L\\'\u00e9cole Montcalm.  Je lui dit, c\\'est pour le secondaire, NON, c\\'est pour le primaire.  J\\'ai pass\u00e9 devant hier, c\\'est \u00e9crit en toutes lettres sur la fa\u00e7ade SECONDAIRE.    Ce matin, je dis, en joke, \"mouais, \u00e7a m\\'apprendra \u00e0 faire du z\u00e8le\" (je suis arriv\u00e9e une demi-heure plus t\u00f4t mais les ordi ne fonctionnent pas), je l\\'entends dire \"Franchement\".  Je lui demande si elle a des nouvelles du p\u00e9riodique en musique, elle r\u00e9pond super b\u00eate \"j\\'travaille pas chez Ebsco, j\\'ai fait mon possible, y\\'a plein de p\u00e9rio qui attendent qui sont plus importants\".  J\\'ai r\u00e9pondu \"ok, de toute fa\u00e7on, who cares\".   Elle m\\'envoie des courriels tout correct, auxquels je r\u00e9ponds l\u00e9g\u00e8rement.  Elle me fatigue.  Peut-\u00eatre suis-je simplement susceptible ces temps-ci, surtout avec tout ce qui se passe en musique, mais je ne suis tout simplement pas capable d\\'endurer ses mood swings.  Elle ne sera pas l\u00e0 vendredi et moi c\\'est la semaine prochaine, \u00e7a va faire du bien.  \u00c9trangement, je tousse beaucoup moins aujourd\\'hui.  Peut-\u00eatre suis-je en train de faire prendre mes distances, de faire ce que je peux faire.  Shanti...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nI can\\'t say it\\'s a bad day, but I can\\'t say everything is going peachy either.  First sign something is wrong is that I\\'m writing this at work when I\\'m overwork and drowned under deadlines.  There is a situation that is so getting to me that I\\'m getting sick again: I\\'m coughing (another bronchitis?) and I\\'m scratching myself.  I love my job usually, and I don\\'t want to leave, but if the situation doesn\\'t improve, I don\\'t know what I will do.  I miss cataloguing books and thesis.  I\\'m losing the little bit of faith I had in me.  I\\'m tired all the time and most of all, I don\\'t care if I don\\'t work correctly.  Last time I did that, I was taking afternoons off without telling anybody.  I was self-destructive so other people would take care of the situation for me.  I guess that to feel better, I have to \"mettre mes culottes\" and take the situation in my own hands.  But I\\'m not feeling very well and moreover, I don\\'t know what to do.  It\\'s bigger than me just not loving a job, it\\'s somebody hating me and doing all sorts of things to make me look bad.  If I could just not care, do my little things while listening to music.  But I\\'m a perfectionist (strangely) and it hurts me that someone hates my work and me.  Especially when I\\'m usually loved (or at least not hated that much) and my work appreciated.  I don\\'t want to be sick again!  I\\'m spending a week in Montreal next week...for music...could it be that I don\\'t want to go so much that it\\'s playing a role in me being sick?  *sigh*  Shanti...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nA few days of break.  Well, kinda, because I took days off to \"babysit\" my son.  Then, on Saturday, we\\'re driving him to the in-laws for a week.  Another holiday for me!  Because, even if I work, I will be able to go at my own rythm and stay at work as long as I want.  Stress free!  Then, it\\'s preparation time to spend a week in Montreal, studying music with Daniel while taking care of Miga and my parents at night.  Can I say that I cannot wait for July 9th to be there?!?  Damn!  I don\\'t know what to reflect on! LOL!  Oh well, let\\'s go clean my desk then...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nSlowness...patience...I'm downloading a one hour TR show; after 5 hours, I have 55% done.  It's a .zip file, I *pray* it's going to work.    I read somewhere that friendship is the most important thing.  Feeling guilty, I sent an email to Cyb, Isa and Sophie.  I had decided a while back to stop being the one always trying to keep up the relationships.  Isa can be busy with the kid, but dammit, I used to have a baby, I was alone all the time and I was able to keep touch.  Sophie hasn't written to me since February and it was because I sent her a email for her birthday, because she had forgotten mine.  Cyb writes more often, and she doesn't even have a computer at home.  This week, I will send an email for Jean's birthday.  Of course, *I* also remember partners and kids birthday.  I am way too nice.  People take advantage of that.  Friends and family take for granted I will keep in touch.  Colleagues and boss take for granted I will do the work, but that I don't need thank-yous or compliments.  Guy takes for granted I'm going to be there for Miga and the house.  Even my psy told me to get mad sometimes.  But I hate confrontation.  Probably a side-effect of my low self-esteem.  I think that I won't win anyway.  I don't want to be nice anymore!  If Isa and Sophie don't answer back, well f*** off.  That's it.    It's so tough to be all alone.  I don't have any close friends, people that I can actually talk to.  I have to write in my journal or the internet.  That's so depressing...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"\"\\n\\nI have to keep memory of  urlLink this link .  The 16th button starting from left is WICKED!  Nice way to procrastinate!  All alone, taking things slooooowly.  Not doing anything, reading and being on the net.  The weather is so-so, windy and menacing clouds.  It's 13:30 and I'm hungry.  A quote that came to my mind:    urlLink Music is soothing   urlLink and calms impatient souls .   Why do I like to look at guys - young, cute guys preferably - when I know pretty well that in real life, *if* I ever find someone, he will have nothing to do with my fantasies?  Am I masochist?  Of course, it's a little bit like looking at a painting, beauty is made for looking at it ;)  And since beauty is in the eyes (or ears) of the beholder, I can look at guys just for the pleasure...and be careful not to take things too seriously, I don't want to get hurt.  Existential question: should I or shouldn't I reveal myself to M.?  Crushes at work are so difficult to manage...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nI created this new blog because...the old one looked stupid!

"female"	"\"\\n\\nI am focusing on 3 things tonight.  1) Claude Rajotte is leaving M+.  He will still be around, he has a show on Radio-Canada.  But listening to radio on Saturday between 7 and 10 p.m. is not something I'm used to do.  I liked watching him on tv, hearing his famous critics.  IMNSHO, he's a pure genius.  I WILL listen to him on radio, even if it means closing the computer and the tv early.  2) The Rasmus...my favorite group right now ;)  Their music and lyrics are great, they give a kick ass show, they're cute, Eero is deeply calm and spiritual.  I adore them and listen to them all the time.  I should learn Finnish.  At least, learn about Finland.  3) Why this blog is in English, since I'm a qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise pure laine.  Well, English IS the international language, so more people can figure out what I'm writing if I get visitors.  Moreover, I need to practice so I don't lose my English.  And finally, sometimes, my thoughts come more easily in English.  But sometimes, I will write in French.  It will depend how inspiration comes to me.  For example, my site  Church of Eero  is in French, despite its English title, because that's how I imagined it.  Hey, why not visit  urlLink my site ? :)\\n\\n\""

"female"	"\"\\n\\nFinally, the week in Montreal wasn't that bad.  It was interesting and fun, I learned a lot of stuff.  I was stressed out at first, but when I decided to put Sylvie out of my mind (for last week and forever), I felt better, more calm.    Actually, I can't wait to come back to work, clean my desk and start anew.  If only I could keep my resolution about exercices and food as well.  *sigh*  I ate so much in Montreal, I gained 3 pounds in 5 days!  And I spent so much, I already have more than 1000$ on my Visa.  Tomorrow, I'll try again.  Less food, less spending.  *re-sigh* Determination has never been my main force...\\n\\n\""

Sometimes she\\'s wrong but she will never accept it.  Oh well.  Another thing to go wrong: Suzan is quitting Guy.  2 nights ago, at 5:00 a.m., he was crying over her.  Gee, nice.  Personally, I think she just needs attention, so she\\'s doing a scene.  But stupidly, Guy asked her to choose between her husband and him.  He can\\'t enjoy things as they are, he always has to run, to be the one in charge, to own.
