This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.

"female"	"\"\\n\\noh, oh...I forgot!  B and I had to run around to purchase patio furniture...so, we are at one store, and we run smack dab into this guy I worked with...a guy that used to tell our friends that if my hubby (then bfriend) ever broke up with me he would be all over me...mind you, he roomed with my hubby for a while as well!  It was a tangled web...he was also friends with one of hubby's friends...anyway!  SO, he and I were talking about life, we had seen his pic in the paper for getting married, etc.  So, B, not getting ample attention, decides to stick his hand down my shirt!  I tried pulling it out, he grabbed onto my shirt and started pulling!!!  Mind you, my shirt was a snap one all the way down!  This guy didn't know quite what to do, and, of course, B wouldn't stop!  Needless to say, 1) I'm sure he got quite the eyeful and 2) I was thoroughly embarassed!\\n\\n\""

I think it has been about a year and a half since we've seen each other...and, we don't really talk on the phone, just email occasionally.  I don't know.  It's weird.

"female"	"\"\\n\\nAre You A Sex Goddess?        A brilliant bolt of lightning descends! SHAZAAM! The oracle has spoken!   The smoke clears to reveal that inside you is a divine being,   DEMETER, Goddess of the Fruitful Earth.   She is a deity who embraces all that man has to offer.  Sex for you is probably just as much of a spiritual experience as it is a physical one. You are an unconventional lover who doesn't feel the need to obey traditional gender roles or follow the norms set by society. Although you are a firm believer in experimentation, you never rush your sexual encounters. It's important for you to experience sex in a deep and profound way. When in the bedroom, you not only surrender your body to the experience, but you allow your mind and your spirit to join the action. Men find you to be a phenomenal lover, and they never fail to be completely elated and fulfilled when the night is over. Sex for you is much more than the sum of its parts. It's an experience that provides you and your partner with an unforgettable moment. For the men who are fortunate enough to share your bed, it's like a light streaming down from the heavens. Behold, the skies proclaim, here lies a goddess!    That's right, boys...you wish you could get a piece of this!  My hubby will be so proud...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nAhhh....life....what a bitch.  Just kidding, just seems to be an extremely eventful time right now...so, where to begin?  I don\\'t really have a long term memory for a lot of stuff, so I will probably forget something I wanted to blog about, oh well...I guess the stuff I remember is the most important, right?  First off, the best part...I finally got my hubby to break and we bought a baker\\'s rack...yippee!  Do you remember when I mentioned I\\'m a bit ocd?  Well, this has been constantly on my mind for the past few months...I\\'ve looked at tons!  I wanted one for the kitchen to hold my microwave.  We had been using a microwave stand I have had since Chicago!  It looks awesome!  It makes the kitchen feel so open and big...and me so happy!  It\\'s the little things in life:)  I saw one on sale at Meijer\\'s, so I convinced him this was the best we would get...which is probably true.  So double whammy, I got the baker\\'s rack AND it was on sale!  Now, for the other crap...Hubby and B went to his family\\'s this weekend...his grandma burns wood for heat, so he went to help the family chop her wood.  So, I stayed home to work on the house.  My big project was refinishing our stairs.  These ugly things have been like this since February...yuck!  So, all week, I have been working on sanding so I could stain and varnish...so, I took half a day on Friday to finish up the sanding and get started.  My friend and I were supposed to go outlet shopping on Saturday, so I stayed up basically all night to get it all done.  Saturday morning...can\\'t sleep, friend hasn\\'t called.  So, I decide to be proactive and get painting.  I needed to prime and paint the underside of the stairs and paint my trim.  So, I pull out the primer and paint.  I start to prime.  Well, there are some spots on the stairs where the varnish and/or stain hadn\\'t completely dried.  So, the primer was simply mixing...so, I decide to stop that and work on the trim.  I am painting away...at the top of the stairs is a window I cannot totally reach, so I bring up a stool.  I\\'m painting away when I shift my weight and a leg of the stool slips off the step.  I catch myself and the stool by grabbing onto the window sill...however, I also was successful in knocking the FULL can of primer down the stairs...from the top it goes clunk, splash, thud!  I was in absolute shock...I stood there just looking down the staircase, unable to fathom what just happened!  A minute later, it dawns on me, this is real, this is bad...so, I run into our bedroom and call mommy.  Trying not to have a nervous breakdown, I explain what I just did...to which she asks, \"Is it oil or water based?\"  To which I reply, \"I don\\'t know\"...well, if it was oil based, you would know because it really stinks.  So, you just have to get a couple buckets of water and wipe it up, keep mopping until you get it all.  I thought, I can do this...so I tredge down the stairs (reminiscent of Titanic when they are wading down the stairs being flooded with water) trying not to make the mess worse than it is...I start cleaning it up, it\\'s a bitch, so I decide I better look at the can...you guessed it, it\\'s OIL based!!!  I quickly call my mom, on the verge of hysterics...\"Oh my word...how did you not smell that?  Okay, get as much mopped up as possible as soon as possible and I\\'ll be over\"  Umm, have I ever mentioned, I don\\'t have a sense of smell?!  So, here I am grabbing all the old kitchen towels, trying to figure out how to get a two inch puddle up...it is going everywhere!  I get as much as possible mopped up and sit down in it all...to start balling.  My newly finished steps are now stark white again...and it had been all I could do to motivate myself to stain and not paint in the first place, and now here I was back at the option of painting...ugh!  My mom comes in, and I tell her, nevermind, this is never going to get cleaned up...well, she has come armed with a dozen chemicals, and we are going to find one that works...thank god and the inventor of mineral spirits!!!  We worked for about three hours scrubbing mineral spirits with steel wool onto those stairs...and got almost all of it up!  Unbelievable!!!  I so wish I had taken a before picture, no words could ever describe how bad it was...even my mom admitted yesterday that she had not thought there was hope!  Halarious?  Yes!  But also scary that my husband still allows me to do most of the improvements!!!  So, hubby and b went to see his family this weekend...and, when he got home, he handed me this card from his brother and sister-in-law addressed to he and I...when I opened and read it, it said \"Aunt S and Uncle S\"...oh, god...she\\'s pregnant.  Of course, hubby was eagle eyed to see how I would react...and, I think I earned an Oscar for my performance...I really want to be happy for them, and I think I am, but I also am dreading the next nine months.  She is three weeks along...how am I going to deal with this when all I want to do is cry?  I want to be sincere, not fake...what a jerk I am!  I feel like a real bitch, and, I probably am.  I was just going to mention to hubby about my wanting to discuss the possibility of taking chlomid...talking to the dr next time I go.  But I know he is now going to think it is because she is pregnant...and, it brings up the whole thing about the fact that all of my maternity clothes, baby clothes, and baby equipment is up north...do I have to give her what is left of our baby and maternity stuff?  I don\\'t know if I could deal with seeing my stuff being used other than by us...I really don\\'t think I can handle watching them use all of my stuff, am I a bitch or what?!  But, now, i know my mother in laws question will be, why don\\'t we just give it to M?  I knew I should have beat them up for this stuff the past two years!  I don\\'t know...I did the good \"sister in law\" thing and got a card and gift to send up there...and, again, I really am happy for them, it just makes it that much more painful for me and it makes it difficult for me to do my usual \"coping\" and just ignore everything that isn\\'t happening...and on top of it, I just feel extremely guilty because I know this all has nothing to do with me but I automatically am thinking of how this is really fucking with my head!    So, the long and short of it?  My life seems never to dull of drama...what I wouldn\\'t give for a quiet, peaceful life...I\\'m not as depressed as I would have been if this all happened a year or so ago...but, it is getting harder to find the humorous side of life...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nOkay...I have like five minutes before a staff meeting...but I have to piggy back off the last entry.  Newlyweds...last night...they are at a restaurant with Nick\\'s brother and his wife.  They ask Jessica if she would like any of the buffalo wings that they are all eating.  She says, \"No, I don\\'t eat buffalo\"...her sil says, \"what?\" Jessica says \"I don\\'t like buffalo\"  Of course, they all CRACK up!  SIL \"They aren\\'t actually made out of buffalo, they\\'re chicken\" Of course, Jessica is royally confused so Nick\\'s brother is trying to explain...finally he says, \"didn\\'t you ever wonder how they were buffalo wings but buffalos don\\'t actually have wings?!\" She says, \"I guess I never thought about that\"...halarious stuff! I am hoping she is cool and can watch this stuff and laugh hysterically at herself...otherwise, she is probably humiliated...I say, hey, we are all freaks, you are just getting paid bucco bucks to air yours on national television!  Anyway...not much else is new.  Work is super frustrating, our computer systems are supposed to be merging but no one can make up their minds to press the on switch...meanwhile, the rest of us are going nuts trying to get everything straightened out...  I get to refinish our stairwell this weekend...whohoo!  Hubby and b are going to his parents to help chop wood for grandma.  So, it will give me the time alone I need to do this project...and a weekend alone!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nNot much new...surprise, surprise, the specialist does want to see me...but doesn\\'t have an appointment until January!  I guess I will take that as a good sign...nothing life threatening?!  I must address a show...NEWLYWEDS.  Can you say frickin\\' halarious?  Ummm...Jessica thought chicken of the sea tuna might mean it is actually chicken, not tuna.  She makes a mess, which she is utterly clueless how to clean up, while she is making her half ass attempt, she asks Nick is she is doing a good job...then asks if they have a mop.  Nick looks at her like she is nuts and says \"How can you ask me if you are doing a good job but you don\\'t know if we own a mop?\"  This girl has obviously been extremely catered to..its kind of sad because she has no idea how to take care of herself, let alone her house and husband.  Makes you wonder what she will do when her parents keel over...but, on a non-deep level, it makes me laugh so hard!  I don\\'t know if anyone else is watching it...I looked it up on MTV and it was a little buried in their site, but, I hope people are...it is so funny!  Kind of like what the first season of the Osbourne\\'s was...  Other than that...my bf stole my sweats and shirt she borrowed when she was at my house...I should have known better than to give her name brand shit.  My CK sweats and a JCrew shirt...I\\'m trying not to be pissed, which would be a lot easier if she wasn\\'t denying that she had them!  She says she left them in my closet, well, I scoured that puppy and was not shocked not to find them...ugh!  I keep trying to tell myself they are just clothes, they don\\'t mean anything, but at the same time, do I need to lock everything up when she comes over?!  I think I\\'m a little ocd...let this serve as an example.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nahhh...I\\'m exhausted...but I have visited all my frequent internet hang outs...so I\\'m left with my blog.  My \"bf\" showed up on my doorstep on Sunday morning.  Her grandma passed away unexpectedly and she had come to see her before she died.  She did not want to be there when hospice took the body out.  Her family life is messed up to say the least.  Her grandma had taken care of her when she was really little and they have been close.  She hung out all day Sunday, spent the night, and was there most of the day Monday.  The funeral is today but I\\'m not sure if I will hear from her again before she leaves tomorrow.  I always forget how high maintenance she is until she is around...she really is like having another kid in the house to take care of...I feel guilty saying that, but it is true!  I think that is why I am so exhausted...  B starts preschool next week...hubby and I had an orientation meeting last night.  As an example of how tired and mentally foggy I am, a lady introduced herself and I offered my hand to shake...I had a small cup of juice in the other hand and dumped it on myself.  It was like I could not focus on more than one thing at a time...I was about to leave because the first part was socializing (which I did not realize until it was almost done, I thought the meeting was just starting extremely late!) and it was so incredibly loud...I wanted to shut my eyes and lay down, I could not deal with it.  I still feel like I am in a fog...my allergies are acting up as well, so maybe the combo of everything is making me this way...I hope.  Anyway, we have an open house tomorrow so B can meet his teacher.  She did her intro and said this is her first \"real job\" since graduating from college...oh, boy.  I have mixed feelings about that, a little apprehensive.  We also realized none of the children from last year are in his class this year...they are in a different 4 year old class.  I think I am going to call to make sure he is in the right class!  I finally had my scoliosis xrays done...according to the report my curve has grown again.  Ugh...how much more can be wrong with my body?  I dropped the xrays and report off to my specialist yesterday, so I\\'m anxious to hear what he has to say about it all.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nOkay, girly...I hope you read this!  I had the right email address, but it says your box is too full!  L~  I got to read your blog this morning...I don\\'t know if this is your email or not!  I\\'m hoping it is, otherwise, whoever is about to receive this will know I am psychotic...  Anyway...blog...no, I really don\\'t think you are screwed up for leaving town and wanting to find yourself...I think that is awesome that you do that!  Besides the crap I was running from, my psycho-ex, my eating disorder, mom and dad, Heritage freaks, etc...that was one of the reasons I left dodge.  Although I didn\\'t have the grand plan to find myself and figure some crazy shit out, I knew I was not going to survive going the way I was going.  And Scott and I had no idea what would happen between us.  I knew that I loved him, but I also broke up with him for a while...I couldn\\'t deal with everything I had to deal with and be concerned for him at the same time...selfish?  Yeah, probably.  But at the same time, I knew in order to ever find out what made me tick, I had to get rid of the static that was diverting my attention from the work.    So, if you and Tony are \"meant to be\", I think you guys will come back together and  be better for the time spent apart.  This is the best time of your life to do this...once you get older and married and kids, you don\\'t get to think about just you anymore.    I think that this is part of what happened to mom when we were little.  I think about what I went through by myself in Chicago...I don\\'t think mom has ever had the liberty to do that.  She dealt with taking care of her mom and then her mom dying...then I think pretty quickly after that she found out she was preggo and her and dad got married.  Where was the time for her to find out what makes her happy?  Maybe that\\'s why she was so angry all the time as we were growing up...she didn\\'t have many choices in what she was doing...she went to a church that didn\\'t condone any type of personal fulfillment ( I swear that looks wrong!) and she was a slave in her home...she had four girls, a hubby who expected her to do just about everything in the house...I couldn\\'t deal!    SO, all that ramble to say...I hope that you find what you are looking for...I hope that you realize the beauty and potential that you posess.  No person is going to complete you, you do that for yourself.  Find what inspires you and grab on...choose to be happy, not tormented.    I love you~Sar\\n\\n'"

In a way I feel guilty, I explained it to one of my other friends, and told her I feel like I am living high school all over...she said, a)I\\'m nuts to allow someone be my friend who steals from me and then lies about it and b) I gave her a fair shot and she still obviously disrespects me so I should let her go...I guess if she never calls again that will be the easiest way to deal with this...but it is never that easy.\\n\\n'"

UGH!  People have to do a lot more than that to be lame in my book...plus, I was funny, so I can\\'t \"recreate\" it...too bad.  Another cool story about my roommate...she met the Bachelor Andrew you know, the one that chose the cute girl Jen...she and our college buddy stood in line for four hours to meet him...and I guess Jen is even cuter and more petite in person!  Plus, I guess Kelly Jo from KALAMAZOO is hanging out with her mom in Wheaton right now...I know my sis was wondering where she was hiding out at...there you go!  And now, to let you know why I am about to be murdered...I have an obsession...eBay.  EVIL!  I can\\'t stop!  First, I wanted to add a layer to my living room...so I decided to go with a collection I\\'ve been wanting to start but know my hubby will not like once he is on to me...kissing.  HA!  So, I am scooping up these figurines and such of people kissing...it is so cute!  Well...then, I was looking under \"kissing\" on Ebay when I came across the most adorable animation... PUCCA!  She is a Korean cartoon and is ADORABLE!  So, I just won a bag of her and am hoping to have the faceplate in a day...I\\'m in deep shit.  But I can\\'t help it...you go find her and tell me if she isn\\'t the cutest thing!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nHey! did you know Matrix will be out in about 2 weeks!  I hope they show his naked ass again...yummy!  Halarious, yet true story...my roomie\\'s hubby has put a personal ad in the yahoo pages...I died of laughter when she told me and it was much better when I saw it for myself!  What a freak!!!  He put this picture of himself in a lake...perhaps to hide the \"few extra pounds\" as he describes it.  I asked her if the fact he lives in his parents basement is a selling point!  Don\\'t think he isn\\'t creative...nope, he took his position as a manager of aquatics at the Y and twisted that to mean Executive Director or some sort of bullshit...hysterical!  And, no, he doesn\\'t sugar coat the fact he had a wife and child yet got another woman pregnant...he admits it...yet another winning facet.  So, my roomie finally admitted she is dating one of our college friends.  She had casually mentioned him when she was here and I asked her about him...she thought I was psychic...lol.  I just told her I was good at reading into people and the fact she had mentioned him told me there was something to that...so, she is secretly dating him, it is complicated.  But he is a sweetie and I\\'m hoping it works out for her...she deserves a break!  The twitch is gone...for now!  I can\\'t tell you how awesome it is not to have it twitching!  That\\'s all I have time for now...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nwow...a whole hour without an eye twitch!  A miracle!!!  I swear it\\'s from work...I don\\'t know why...perhaps it is my peers bugging me to help make a quilt for the devil\\'s baby...and being the only one with balls and integrity to say no.  I mean, I hate hypocrites...and wouldn\\'t I be one if I did this?  I think so!  But, my posse has a good idea, tell them I\\'ve changed my mind and make one...with a BIG BLACK SHEEP!  HA!  Oh, I had it out with bf...well, if you could call it that.  I called her when I got home.  She was in the car with her hubby and kids, so I politely asked if now was a good time.  Well, we sat in silence until she asked why I was mad.  I told her I didn\\'t understand her point to calling and bitching at me at work.  SHe flipped saying \"I was so kidding!\" I said, well, you said you were partly serious.  To which she went off about how I never call anymore, blah, blah blah.  I said it was hard to call and talk to someone who had no interest in what was going on with me and didn\\'t have time to listen, just wanted to talk about what was going on with her.  She was offended, didn\\'t expect her not to be.  She wanted me to explain my statements...so I recounted the million times I called and she would unleash her life story then turn around and say she had to go if I tried to talk.  She denies...big surprise.  So, I told her, you don\\'t have a clue what is going on with my life, you don\\'t ask, you aren\\'t there when I try to talk...she thought I meant literally, so she told me to leave messages (umm, you don\\'t have a machine!)...why must I deal with morons?!    Basically, it boils down to...she doesn\\'t think I ever tried to talk, she isn\\'t here so I can\\'t expect her to be, and she needs me to blatantly ask for support...few issues, a)her hubby was in the background telling her what to say...you know what, dude? YOu don\\'t have a clue what I\\'M saying so shut the fuck up...b)no shit you aren\\'t here, I am not asking you to physically be here, and if you don\\'t get that, well why are we having this discussion?!, c)halariously ironic...the next day, I got a cosmo girl magazine (don\\'t ask!) and they had this article/blurb about friends...something to the effect, true friends are there for each other without being asked...okay, if teenagers get that, how did you lose that vital piece of 411!  To top it off, at the end of that, to which I just said, you obviously don\\'t get where I am coming from, and I\\'m tired of talking about it...she asked, so what\\'s been going on?  I laughed so hard I about wet myself...are you kidding me?!  I just told you, I don\\'t tell you shit anymore because you aren\\'t there...I have other people in my life who provide me with that...and yes, that means I am questioning why you are in my life, because, so far, all you do is use and steal... but I just found this funny...so, will I call her?  Why?  I don\\'t call the people I do love and need...those who are there to support.  So before I call her lame ass, I think I will put back to those who have given to me...not stolen (sorry, I had to add that in there!)  Well, it was the day of sisters yesterday...big sis called...my bil is going to be a pastor!  Halarious!  I just find it so ironic...I don\\'t know why, because, to those HCA jacks I wouldn\\'t have been good enough to be related to a pastor!  Well, booyah!  Then, little sis called...she is in a black hole...and I feel really bad for her, not in a pity way, but because I really can identify with her situation...she misses her friends and wants to come home...I don\\'t think I really helped, I tried to lead her through the logical reasons why she should NOT come...when you\\'re emotional, you want to kill people like me...but, she has just seemed so happy...and who wouldn\\'t be?  She got away, she is on the road to success.  I\\'m so skeptical of friends...so I don\\'t think anyone should relocate just for friends.  I know the friends that I have are my friends no matter where I live and offer that support... I don\\'t really know what to say to her, I just don\\'t think what I said should have been it.  I hope she gets past the initial hurt and takes a step back to analyze.  Kzoo is not right for right now...and friends that would pressure you to change your life for them, aren\\'t real friends.  Friends are supposed to support 110%...unless life threatening, or illegal (sometimes)!  So, not the type of friends I would relocate for.  But there lies a major difference between sis and I...at the end of the day, I truly don\\'t give much of a rip what people think of me or what I do, she does.  Of course, I\\'m nuts anyway, so take my opinion with a grain of salt!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nWhy, you ask, am I posting twice in the same week?  Because I am so not in the mood to work and I am stuck here until 2pm...ugh.  SO, I have read my email, my community board, a couple other sites, and now I\\'m here...I really don\\'t even feel like talking, so I haven\\'t replied yet to those emails (I WILL LISA!!!) nor did I post to the boards...I\\'m tired of talk.  I had the strangest, freakiest, nasty dream last night...I was a lesbian, which isn\\'t exactly the nasty thing, freaky most definitely...but I was a lesbo with my bf, who is in questionable status.  And, we were trying to hide it from all of these Heritage people...for, duh, obvious reasons.  But then mr x came and I was fighting with bf so I wanted to be with him...I think something I ate right before bed does not agree with me!!!  So, to my dream last night, ew, don\\'t come back!  Did I mention my roommate decided to divorce her hubby?  Good...he\\'s a loser... Did I mention I have missed the past TWO weeks of Real World?  AND Newlyweds?    Thankfully, I have caught Newlyweds on re-runs...but where are the RW re-runs?  I really needed to see Leah get yelled at and CT go postal.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I think Leah is gorgeous...I even forgive her that she is blonde.  I wonder what size she is...she looks larger than Mallory and Christina, but those two look like twigs.  Anyway...I went to Leah\\'s site...wow...so hot!  And, she doesn\\'t appear to goup herself up...I think she makes me laugh because she is so like my bf who thinks, I can walk into Gucci and give them shit because if I wanted that bag I would have it but choosing not to because I still like my model from last year better than this crappy version...watching Leah makes me appreciate myself...I\\'m sorry, it is hard to deal with people who like to be loud and obnoxious 24/7 and I DO think I should get a medal for hanging in there!  And CT?  He is so weird it is halarious!  Seriously, he is what I envision most caring guys to be like...trying to figure out the female population turns them neurotic...halarious!  But, we\\'ll see if he gets kicked off because of his actions...they looked borderline on the preview and since no one believes in stepping in and stopping this shit before it goes down, so these people can be humiliated on public tv...whatever.  I mean, there have been very few times, but they have been there, where I want to take someone out back and beat them, to death...so, it happens to the best of us.  And, have you seen the crap he has put up with?  I would have killed someone, or at least verbally attacked them, a LONG time ago!  I give him credit for hanging in there...his roommates have been really mean and nasty to him...poor CT...  Wow...I really need to get a handle on watching reality tv...next thing you know Charla and I will be having coffee!  LOL...did I mention THAT...oh, Lord, that girl should feel like crap.  Paradise hotel...Keith decides to keep Charla and Dave.  All four (Tara is the other) must swap roommates for the vote.   So Charla and Keith win...and are given 250K and told they can either walk away with the check or split it with their \"original\" partner...they have 30min to decide.  Toni (UGH) hunts down Charla and convinces her NOT to give Dave the money...he doesn\\'t deserve it, no one out there thinks he does, blah, blah, blah...didn\\'t she watch the episodes?  Doesn\\'t she get she would be doing herself a favor by SHUTTING UP?!  Anyway, Keith decides to give Tara half (I love him so much!) and Charla KEEPS IT ALL!  Last time I checked, you needed him and vice versa not to get kicked off!  Greedy, greedy!  At least she made up my mind for me...Tara I like better.  When Keith was telling her he was giving half of it, she was trying to convince him to keep it all for himself...what a friend.  Oh yeah, then Tara and Keith told everyone they were funding a trip for everyone to Vegas.  Now, I know this crap is pieced together...but there is no way I would have done that after the way they were treated...  Anyway...glad my life is so exciting I need to talk about TV!  There\\'s junk to talk about, but I just don\\'t wanna...maybe later...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nWow...i love how everytime I log on, blogger looks different.  Makes me feel like I have been neglecting my blog!  What a funk I was in!  Not so bad anymore.  I think part of it has to do with shitty friends that won\\'t leave me alone...and I must say, I am using the word friend very loosely!  My \"friend\" emailed me to see if I was having a Pampered Chef party anytime soon...I told her no, my mil can order if you want...well, lo and behold, she has started selling Mary Kay.  Why don\\'t you just ball up and ask if I will have a party?  That\\'s what kills me...you only want me around when you can use me, but you don\\'t even have the guts to admit it.  Why don\\'t I block her email???  Because I\\'m too nice and am a glutton for punishment!  Anyway...this weekend was good.  Skipped work Friday (seeing a theme?)...had a gyn appointment, though...so it wasn\\'t all fun and games.  Anyway, talked to him to get his take on clomid.  He thinks we should give the metformin 6months to kick in.  He seems to think it will make everything return to normal, including ovulation.  Then, during the exam, he seemed to think I was ovulating or was primed to ovulate!  Hope restored!  Which, scares me, quite frankly.  I already have my hopes back up and what happens when it doesn\\'t happen?  Anyway, he reassured me we most likely would NOT have multiples...so, that relaxed hubby.  Actually, hubby has been really cool.  He is very open to actively trying at the beginning of the year...or at least talking about it.  Which is a start!  I thought I would have to fight him tooth and nail to get him to that point!  But, I think he knows how much I want this, and that ultimately, we all want it.  And, we both agree, we are in such a better place than when we were pregnant the first time.  And, he knew it wasn\\'t all coming up just because his brother and his wife are pregnant!  Got a couple closets cleaned out...the house if finally semi-clean again...and we can park in the garage finally!  Such accomplishments!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nwow...I love having a long weekend.  I basically left at noon on Wednesday, with nothing to do, there is only so much surfing one can take...so the rest of the day Wednesday and Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday...wow...going to work tomorrow is really going to suck...lol.  So, I decided NOT to knit...to give myself a real break.  It has been so nice.  I have read two books...watched some movies...taken naps...gone shopping...went to see Matrix on the IMAX...took B to see Brother Bear...  What a wonderful break.  It reminds me of the good old days when I was depressed and could just wrap up in covers all day long and never get up.  I miss those days.  I couldn't sleep at night, so I would sleep for about four hours and then get up and watch movies or read.  Okay, I did start knitting today, but other than that I have been good!  Do you ever have a friendship you think is really great and then you find out that it isn't?  Well, that happened to me.  My boss and I, I thought, were good friends.  I mean, he is really cool and really flexible with me and we joke around with each other, the guy gripes to me about his problems all the time and asks for advice...normal friend stuff.  Well, he has been working on making wood working stuff to sell at a craft show.  He had reserved a booth a while ago.  I started knitting these bags/purses and he asked me if I wanted to put them in his booth and sell them.  I didn't take him serious at first but then everyone started to tell me I should sell them...I figured, what do I have to lose?  So, I started making these bags to sell...last week, he says to me,  so what do I get out of all of this?   Understand, I thought he was kidding!  So I said, a thank you and a smile.  He said,  How about 10%?   I must have given him a Barto look because then he said,  okay, 5%?   I told him I would have to do the figures...but I don't get it...now you are trying to make money off of me???  Whatever!  I was so shocked at first...then hurt...now pissed.  What a jerk.  See, the thing is, he was supposed to sell his stuff at a store, well, he and I went out there and this guy that co-owned was really rude to him and basically told him no thanks.  Bill was so bummed about it, so on the way back to work, I told him to stop at this other store because I thought they sold wood working crap...and, sure enough, this guy is now interested in selling his stuff!  Ummm...you wouldn't have gotten that contact if it wasn't for me!  So what is MY kickback?  Then, in this same conversation, he wants to know if my friends that have the writing/graphic arts business will put together a business card for him...yeah right!  I told my friend and she cracked up!  I told her she should charge him at least double...ha!  So, it will be interesting to see if he brings it up tomorrow.  jackass.  Not much else is new...this week should be non-eventful...just trying to get things done in case I decide to do the craftshow...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nOkay...so can we say the holidays are a tad depressing?  My LORD!  I\\'m okay...really...just in a funk.   Hey, ladies...I\\'m just bummed so I need to spout off...don\\'t mind me, LOL!   I think it is a yearly tradition for me to go into depression around B\\'s birthday...what a great mom I am.  I just can\\'t get past the desperate desire to have another baby...last week!  So, when Brennan\\'s birthday comes, I feel like I am getting further away from the \"ideal\" timeline for two kids.  If it doesn\\'t happen next year, I seriously don\\'t know if we will still try.  And then, there is B.  At his party, my friends one year old was there tormenting him, so I though \"whew, maybe he will stop asking for a sibling because of this\"...ummm, wrong.  Last night we were on the couch reading a story (\"Polar Express\"), this child gets to choose the first present of the season...B says, I would say I want a baby sister.  I\\'m crying just thinking about it...he has gone from saying he wants one, to asking why we don\\'t...and the best I can come up with is \"because this is how God made our family\".  I\\'m sure I must be so convincing.  My heart is breaking and I feel like his is too.   To top it off, my sister in law was at the party...she is 14 weeks along and of course that is all everyone wanted to talk about...I thought I had prepared myself for it...I didn\\'t do a good job.  I couldn\\'t even look at her when she came into the house.  Then my father in law said it was me and hubby\\'s turn for another one, I just looked at him.  He said \"I don\\'t even get a response\"...rather than burst into tears or rip his head off (or both! LOL) I just shook my head.  I think they forget they we, well I, have issues...   I would be angry...but I am too tired...I hate this, I hate PCOS, I hate it, hate it, hate it...I just want to curl up under the covers and hide.  I\\'m tired of being tired, I\\'m tired of not being able to sleep, I\\'m tired of not having a normal body, I\\'m tired of the aches and pains, I\\'m tired of the hair, I\\'m tired of the memory loss, I\\'m tired of the acne, I\\'m tired of the weight, I\\'m tired of the meds, I\\'m tired of people in my life forgetting...I\\'m just really really exhausted from all of this...and not convinced it will get better.    to top it all off I am freezing my butt off...well I guess that could be a good thing, lol...it is snowing here and I am cold...has anyone else noticed an unusual sensitivity to cold?  Literally, I used to be able to go throughout winter without wearing a coat...now I am sitting at my desk and I have yet to take my coat off...I\\'m cold!!!   I\\'m sorry if this was depressing...I\\'m fine, I\\'ll be fine...I just have to try harder to find the silver lining and right now it is covered in snow...ha! Take care, dears~S\\n\\n'"

"female"	"\"\\n\\nahhh...what a lovely weekend.  Halloween was nothing special.  B was Woody and we dressed Spike up as Buzz Lightyear...it was pretty funny.  Spike did not like the costume and came and hid his head in my arm, too cute!    We watched my parents dog...he pooped and pee'd throughout the main floor, I was ready to kill him by the time it was time to send him home...  My in laws came...boy was my mil in an exceptionally bitchy mood.  Oh, this was funny too...they are all telling me (Hubby's aunt, uncle, and grandma also came) how his sil has all these cravings and is oh so moody because of the pregnancy...ummm, hello?! She is only seven weeks along...HA!  Most people do not even KNOW they are pregnant at that time...except for those who are majorly trying...she also has gained four pounds.  Boy, I sure hope she continues to pack them on...to that, I would say KARMA.  But, anyways, I was so trying to keep my mouth shut, but I must have gotten a look.  My fil says, I keep trying to tell them this is all in their head, that it is too soon.  I just said, EXACTLY!  I can't wait to see if they come to B's party and if she is bitching about being pregnant then...ugh.  annoying...  anyway...my sis has gone mia again...oh, where are you?  I need to know about your couch so we can get it out of the garage and park inside again...BEFORE the snow!\\n\\n\""
"female"	"\"\\n\\nI love long weekends...especially, when Christmas is stuck in the middle!  I feel pretty spoiled this Christmas...some earrings, a ring, comfy pjs...a computer...and other stuff I don't remember at the moment...oh, yeah, the new Dido and Britney cds!!!  yippee!  anyway...the psychic...when I first entered and sat down, she said...wow, your aura is beautiful...what do you say to that?  She says...I can see that you have a very complete life...everything is balanced...you have such love in you that your heart is bursting...you love to laugh and love living...but, your angels are so sad...they are saying that you used to talk to them and consult with them and you have shut the door on them...they are so sad and wish that you would recognize that you are older and more able to handle the communication...they wish that you would trust them again and let them help you along...  Then she did like a generic reading...I should have written this earlier, but I didn't, so I'm just going to put what i remember and if it comes out, it comes out, otherwise I've forgotten a lot...  I will be traveling a lot this next year...I don't need to worry, finances will not be an issue...I will meet a tall man with dark hair and green eyes that will be my soulmate.  I will be having a change of job in the next 2-3 weeks and the people in my present position will offer glowing references...I will have a change of residence in 2-3 weeks but not to worry, it is for the best, and, again, finances will not be an issue, I will be better off...someone will try to take advantage of me financially, so beware!  I also need to be aware for the next 3-4 days as someone will try to steal from me (She said this is not uncommon to get that in the reading around the holiday)...travelling kept coming up...financial security kept coming up...the man I am supposed to meet kept coming up...so I finally asked if he was different than my husband...she said, yes, he appears as a stranger but someone you have a deep connection to, so he could be someone you don't know but connect with or someone you used to know or don't know very well...but you and your husband will not be together in 6-8weeks...there is a lack of communication and there will be lies and betrayal.  he loves you very much but you are independent and strong and the relationship will be ended...I asked about kids...I will not have any more, there will be a possibility in 10years, but by then I will feel it is too late...she says I need to remain friends with samantha...that I am very loving and giving to her, that I tolerate her personality when most people do not...it is not readily seen to me what benefit I receive from our friendship, but that I need to continue with it...  And, that is pretty much the gist of what was said...if I remember more, i will write it down...no, I didn't get stolen from, and so far, I still have the same job...but we will see...\\n\\n\""
