This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.

"female"	"'\\n\\nI forgot to cover American Idol!  My lord were the judges rude!  I know it is their job to critique, and I agreed that most of them had some issues on Tuesday...but why comment about someone\\'s weave!  My LORD!  It was like she sang well but we don\\'t like her so let\\'s find something else to rip on...oh, her hair!  The kid who sings like Frank did horrible, and I have heard that the judges had him in tears after the show...my god!  This kid is what, 16?! Leave him alone!!!  I agree, his voice is geared for one genre...but he does a mean impersonation...he is so dorky, he is cute...the thing is...even if these people have \"bad nights\" they are tons better than the majority of people who get up to do karaoke...  I didn\\'t vote...haha!  Still only the one time...my favorites are still George and Fantasia...those two rock!  They had best make it into the top three...I\\'m not sure who else I would choose...the thing is, the rest are all kind of on the same level...they are good but not consistent.  I must say, I was glad Amy went home.  Don\\'t get me wrong, she has a good voice...but those times where she just went all airy/breathy and couldn\\'t really hit the notes just happened too often for me.  You can\\'t hit those, stop trying and stop picking songs that make you do that...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nLordy...I hate having to do actual work when I am at work...I\\'m not really sure WHAT I did, but yesterday, I never stopped...ugh.  I had some shitty training that I have had to attend four different versions of already.  I sit in the room and see people who I KNOW have already been told this crap and they have questions that have ALREADY been answered previously...people are morons!  To add to my joy of cubicle living, I have been informed I am being moved into building 306...that\\'s right, the den of evil.  It is going to be miserable...no more anonymity, plus, I am sitting right by one of the entrances AND the only bathrooms in the building...ew!  My boss couldn\\'t care less...he is on the opposite side of the building from management and is happy...meanwhile, I am in the center of traffic and will be visible to all...bastard...  On a halarious note, hubby called last night from work...he told me he had \"ordered\" us a present.  I was highly suspicious because if my hubby sees something he wants, it is usually in the back of a magazine or catalog but he was telling me that the surprise is free.  I asked him if he would give me a \"hint\" to which he just told me what he ordered...a better sex video and booklet and some other surprises are in it!  LMAO...I was laughing so hard!  See, I\\'m considered the \"freaky\" one and he is always so resistant to new things...he liked his kama sutra book I got him for Christmas a couple years ago, but he only reads up on a new position every three-four months...so at this rate, we won\\'t be through it before the next life.  I guess this radio station he listens to had a \"sex expert\" on and they were giving away these better sex kits.  My hubby decided it sounded cool and called in to order us one...haha!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nokay...I\\'ll admit it...I\\'m officially an emotional wreck at the moment...Lord, I really do love these hormonal rollercoasters I get to ride on!  This one I jumped on at the moment is called \"Time of the month Hell\"  Of course, if you don\\'t choose to ride this ride as often as you should, say once a month, it tends to be that much worse when you do get on...yesterday, I was a WRECK!  I was tearing up and occassionally breaking down in tears at random moments...beautiful!  So, before my hormones went to hell yesterday, I called my sister and brother in law...aka the whackjobs in TC that just gave birth to my first niece.  I called because I wanted to see how the new mom was doing, how baby was doing, and how they were all adjusting after coming home from the hospital.  Bad move...she called me back here at work and went on and on about how she gave birth naturally and how my bil has such HUGE respect for women who choose to do it completely naturally.  Hey, dumbass, just because I had drugs doesn\\'t make it any less of a challenge to push a baby out of that teeny-tiny hole.  Ahhh, I hope she achieved whatever it was she attempting to do...make herself feel good?  I don\\'t know.  I have never regretted my decision to get drugs...I guess it is just annoying that she should think her birthing experience was more miraculous than anyone who had drugs.  Guess what, brainiac?  It\\'s God\\'s miracle in the first place...he just chose to use you as a tool...needless to say, I won\\'t be calling them for quite some time...  Luckily, hubby completely understood.  See, I called from work and had to leave a message.  I didn\\'t leave my work number, I just figured I would talk to them later in the afternoon.  So, they called our house to get my work number from hubby.  Hubby and his brother talked for a while about how they were doing...hubby had told his brother that I had been anxious to hear how everyone was doing and that I must have finally broke down and done it myself since he hadn\\'t.  Brother asks him if we had thought about having more children...they were so excited we had dropped everything to come see them and to watch us with the baby, they were impressed and wondered why we hadn\\'t had more yet.  So, hubby says, I could have sworn we have had this conversation...and goes into the whole, she has been told it won\\'t happen naturally...bs.  Wow...I don\\'t even really know what I think.  I think I don\\'t want to think about it...anyway, brother kept going on and on about how he was so thrilled we came up right away and hubby had called ME before they called back to let me know the conversation and \"forewarn\" me she would probably go on and on about how much our visit meant...ummm, nope!  Nothing like that was even alluded to...so hubby is thoroughly disgusted, especially considering what he and his brother had talked about.  Like I told him, I am a sensitive enough person NOT to say such bs to someone but the downside is that I am sensitive to then get my feelings hurt when someone says that crap to me...I need to learn to let this stuff run off my back and not effect me...  On a much, much happier note...I was able to stay awake and watch AI.  GO FANTASIA!  LOL!  I never got through the night before so I was a little stressed she might not win.  Oh yeah, did you see the point JASMINE went to sing and Jennifer Love Hewitt called her Jennifer???  DUH!  Read the cue cards girl!  Anyway, I was so happy for Fantasia...and, of course, it made me cry!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nwow...I just feel so, strange...I don\\'t know, it is weird.  I\\'m like in between melancholy and happy I guess.  I am not depressed but I\\'m not my usual self either.  I don\\'t really know how to describe it...I feel so much more introverted than I usually am...more self-reflective...  So, sister in law had the baby...we got a call on Friday night to say she had been having contractions.  Well, every first time mom thinks they are about to have a baby so both hubby and I kind of poo-poo\\'d it.  Well, low and behold, Saturday morning I got a call at 7:30am to say they were in the hospital.  Hubby and I had a long talk/fight about what to do.  I was so opposed to going up there...not because I didn\\'t want to see the baby, because I did.  Finally, I was able to verbalize, I didn\\'t want \"us\" to be in turmoil again like what happened after the shower.  I didn\\'t want to put myself in such a vulnerable place to be hurt and then have him take their side.  I was scared.  But after being able to say all of that to him, I saw in his eyes how important it was to him to go.  We were supposed to have our friends from IN come...well, hubby said to have them come and he would go by himself.  I called T and explained...told her I just felt I needed to be there with him, she completely agreed and wished me luck.  I know she doesn\\'t understand me 99% of the time, but I love her...she is such a good person and is such a great friend to me.    Anyway, I cried to my mom about how scared I was.  Please understand, I am not upset they were having a baby...it just brings to the forefront something I try so hard to ignore so I can go about my life...it may never happen again for us.  Add to that vulnerability and hurt the fact that his family always makes cruel comments regarding this...I just was dreading the inevitable abuse I was about to put myself in front of.  Mom said she had no idea what I was feeling like...but encouraged me to realize I was doing the right thing and I was being the bigger person...then my preggo sister called.  Talked to her for a while...kinda get the picture I was trying my best to delay??? I was!  So, we finally get ready and leave at 11:45am...car trips with toddlers!  Literally, ten minutes after we leave...\"I gotta go potty.\"  YOU JUST WENT!  Lordy...what is normally a 2 1/2 hour trip took almost 5 HOURS!!!  Three stops for the bathroom, one for gas (and the bathroom) and one for lunch.  We finally got there at 4:30pm...man!  And, of course, it was freezing and we had dressed for the hot and humid weather we had.  I actually had commented to hubby that we should pack coats...but we both kinda laughed it off and said there was no way it was going to be cold there...wrong-o!  I can\\'t believe how good the baby is...she barely cried while we were there.  We stayed for about an hour and a half.  Hubby immediately wanted to hold her, which he usually is very apprehensive about babies.  At first, I didn\\'t know if I could...but hubby kind of shoved her in my arms.  He always knows exactly what I need...it immediately took my mind off the bigger picture and I got to hold my new niece, Leslie Maxine...I\\'m not going to say she was cute, I\\'m not a fan of newborns...wait a few months and I\\'m sure I will find her adorable but babies are just not my thing...anyway!  Yes, I got all kinds of, \"when are you going to have another?  don\\'t you think B wants a sibling?\"  \"B, you should tell mommy you want a baby too\"  all the inappropriate bullshit people impose...and, yeah, it hurts...alot.  But, we left to go meet hubby\\'s parents for dinner and stopped at Old Navy and I was able to nurse my wounds with retail therapy.  Yesterday, I slept basically all day.  Hubby woke me up for some breakfast and I took a bath...then he woke me back up at 2pm when he left for work.  I can\\'t explain why I was so tired...but I was.  Hubby says I just seemed so sad...I guess I kind of am.  I want to have another baby but neither of us want to take the next step of intervention.  Part of me thinks, do it, try it, get what you want.  The other part of me says, if it is meant to be it will happen.  That part always wins out...but what happens if I regret that decision when I get older?  And part of me wonders, why isn\\'t it meant to happen?  Do I suck so bad at being a parent God doesn\\'t want to entrust me with another?  To top it off...my breasts are hurting...damn.  Of course, my heart says, oh, I\\'m pregnant!  But my head says, you are about to have a period.  So, I look at my calendar and it has been two months since the last one.  Ugh...I\\'m really off track again.  I swear I don\\'t want to spend another cent on a hpt...those damn things have gotten enough money from me!  But on the other hand, do I sit here and constantly question until a week or so when it shows up?  Better to put myself out of my misery I think...  So, no, I\\'m not depressed...I don\\'t know what I am...self-reflective...\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nok...so I better write about this dream before I forget everything.  Mr X was there...he had been searching for me for a long time and finally found me.  He told me he wanted to talk to me \"alone\".  So, we went to this place, I assume it was his house.  He started asking me many random questions about my life and what I had done, etc.  I told him I was happy now and that I never knew I could be happy without him but that I was.  He kept pounding me about, well, when we were together, was this real, was that real...etc.  He wanted me to assure him that I had truly loved him.  I told him, of course, I was in love with you, I never would have gone through all the bs if I hadn\\'t but it isn\\'t the same anymore...and it never will be the same.  I told him I was such a different person without him and that I was with someone who inspired me to continue growing.  Enter hubby...hubby came to find me because he had heard I was with Mr X.  Hubby was crushed that I was with him and assumed that I was there because I wanted to leave him and go to Mr X.  I tried explaining to hubby that I was simply trying to explain to Mr X how much happier I am and how he and I were never going to be together again.  Well, in the background Mr X is getting more and more upset.  Finally, I convince hubby to leave and let me finish the conversation with Mr X and that I would be coming to him shortly.  Well, Mr X told me, no, I\\'m not going to let you leave me again.  And then I was dead.  I didn\\'t see myself die so I have no idea what happened...weird, huh?  The rest of my dream was me, dead, telling hubby how much I love him and how much I appreciate everything he has ever done for me...  Now, that I relay it, it is kind of a sad dream I guess.  But when I first woke up, I was so relieved by it.  Finally...I realize in my subconscious that I have made the right choices for me and I\\'m exactly where I need to be.  I have been so haunted by Mr X for years...and here, after nine years together, I finally get it right...too long in coming.  I am not going to read too much into the rest of it...just take the peace that Mr X should not be haunting me anymore.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nOur weekend was good.  We got to go see Lis in Chicago.  It wasn\\'t warm but it wasn\\'t raining either.  We were at the McCormick Center which is right on the water, it is just south of the aquarium and museums at Soldier Field, so it was pretty windy.  It was so much fun!  They have these huge tents set up where you get to drive all of their cars.  Hubby\\'s favorite was the little two seater Crossfire and realistically, I really liked the Pacifica.  I did get to drive the Volkswagon Bug.  Uh-oh, not good...hubby could barely fit in the backseat!  The guy who rode with us pushed his seat all the way forward and Scott still was scrunched back there...lol!  Plus, it was a convertible so I doubt he could have made it with the top up!  I guess I will be waiting a LONG time for my bug...haha!  Anyway, they had all these courses set up for you to drive and see the different features of their cars...of course, B and I both loved the part where we got to hit the gas and slam on the breaks at the last second...lol!  We were there for about four hours, driving the different cars, watching a cigar rolling demonstration, just hanging out with Lis and her friends.  Then we drove out to Oak Brook for our favorite pizza...yummy!   Sunday we just picked up the house, did a little yard work, and hung out.  My friend and her son came over and we took the kids to the carnival that was in the parking lot of Wings.  We were there for several hours as the kids rode most of the rides.  B has about 6 inches to go before he can ride the adult rides...boy was he upset!  He wanted to ride the Ferris Wheel so badly and all the other \"adult\" rides.  It was so funny!  They had one of those huge slides where you walk up this incredibly high staircase and slide down on something that looks like a potato sack.  Well, he was tall enough to go alone so I told him he could do it, thinking he would never make it up the stairs.  It took him about three minutes to get up the stairs.  He kept stopping and just standing there and then he would start back up.  I was just laughing because it looked like he was trying to convince himself to go up...after he went down once, he was hooked.  His friend wanted to go after watching B do it but backed out once he was on the top...B just said, \"I\\'m not scared of anything!\"  But when he was relaying this all to hubby he tells him, \"The stairs made me a little worried but then I remembered I\\'m not scared...\"  too funny!  The two kids did not get along and I was getting pretty disgusted.  My friend was NOT policing her child.  I understand B was misbehaving as well, but I was all over him when he was naughty.  She was just letting it continue...her kid was calling B names and being really mean.  Finally, I had enough.  I know it isn\\'t appropriate to parent someone else\\'s child but my child was being hurt in the process.  So, I started telling him to cut it out.  The final ride of the evening, this kid hauls off and punches B.  I yell at him to leave his hands to himself.  Not two seconds later, this kid is slapping him.  I yell out, \"C! Get your hands off B NOW!\"  At that point, my friend says, I think it is time to go home.  YOU THINK???  She had driven us so they had to drop us back at our house.  While we are enroute, C says, can we go and play at their house?  She tells him, we\\'ll see.  Hell no!  So I pipe in, B and I are going to be taking naps when we get home.  I was not about to invite this kid into my house to beat on B some more.  I know, I know, I sound like one of those overprotective moms...but really, this shit had gone on for a really long time and I didn\\'t feel I was protecting B by allowing this kid to act like a maniac and yelling at B when he would start doing the same thing.  Needless to say, it will be a very long time before we get together with them again!  anyway...I finally had a dream with some closure...I will relay it later.  I\\'ve been avoiding work for almost two hours now!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nI don\\'t have anything important to say, but I am desperately trying to avoid going to work...  Well, it seems to be working for the moment.  I have been taking a fish oil pill before I go to bed and I seem to be okay.  It is really amazing how much better I feel.  I was so sick for the past few weeks and was really getting down in the dumps about it.  I feel so much better!  I think I will do this for a week or two and then try two pills again.  I\\'ve been feeling so good that I decided I need to get on the ball with excercise.  I hate saying this because I always flake out but I really am trying.  I keep envisioning myself on that cruise ship fat and presto! there\\'s some motivation!  I\\'m trying to build up a tolerance to running.  I know that walking is really good for you but the results come so much slower.  I would much rather just beat my body into compliance and then walk to maintain.  Not asking too much, eh?  I can run an embarassing amount of time before I a)can\\'t breathe and b) my back feels like it is going to break.  Well, I guess I need to go back to the dr for my inhaler...ugh.  Anyway...hubby is in training this week so B is in daycare all day and then we are all home together at night.  Wow...it is so nice.  I feel guilty about B but spending time as a family at night is really cool.  It makes me hopeful for when he is done with school and hopefully can bid for first shift...I didn\\'t realize normalcy felt so good...  Thursday is the award ceremony at work.  I\\'m so glad I\\'m feeling better...this gives me a better chance of not crying when hubby receives his award.  I guess this award symbolizes all the sacrifices we have made as a family, as a couple, and on individual levels.  It also allows him to close some doors on the trials he faced last year.  I\\'m just so proud of him...  See?  I warned you I had nothing important to say!  I fell asleep on the couch watching \"America\\'s Next Top Model\" update show...damn!  I really wanted to see it!  Maybe they will replay it someday...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nWow...Blogger has really changed this up...it looks so cool and, hopefully, will be easy to use!  What a good weekend!

We didn\\'t do a whole lot...actually, I\\'m pretty sure I zonked out on the couch by 7-7:30pm!  Thankfully, I woke up around midnight to wake up hubby and get us up to bed.  Saturday, hubby had training all day so it was just B and I.  I was able to get a lot of the basement cleaned out, yippee!  We also stopped by my parents house for some hostas my mom was breaking up.  Lis was there...thank god they didn\\'t notice her tongue ring while we were there!!!  That would have been pure hell...and, thankfully, they are going to see her on Sunday so we won\\'t be in Chicago at the same time either...I\\'m dreading the phone call when they do find out!  It didn\\'t look gross at all, but for some reason I was completely freaked out by it...  Sunday...B and hubby gave me my presents...too spoiled!  I got the cd player for my car I\\'ve been bugging him about...mind you, I didn\\'t expect it for mother\\'s day!  I just wanted to use the extra cash we had burning up for it...I also got a window box and another big planter...that means flowers!  Hubby was funny...in the morning before I opened them, I showed him the cd player at Circuit City for sale.  He says, I guess we better save our pennies.  HA!  I never saw it coming!!!  Then, when I opened the planters, he says, yes, I am well aware this means you need to buy MORE flowers...lol, he knows me so well.  Oh, yeah...they also gave me this beautiful orchid corsage.  Now, I am not the corsage type, so when we went out to eat, I put it in my hair...B loved it.  He kept asking if boys can wear flowers in their hair because \"it\\'s so cool\"...so, I promised him I would wear it to work today so everyone could see it too...I love my boys!  Back to the grindstone...I decided to go drug free this weekend.  I just mentally could not take another day of being exhausted and nauseous all day.  Surprisingly (PLEASE NOTE SARCASM), I felt fabulous all weekend.  Hubby was concerned because he knows I will pay for it once I start back up(today!) but I really needed the mental reprieve.  I felt like a new person this weekend...gone were the mood swings, gone was the exhaustion, gone was the nausea...it was like the old me was back...I miss her...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nPeople annoy me...the older I get, the more introverted I become.  I am really starting to believe it is because I am so easily annoyed with people...  case in point:  I have a friend that is getting a divorce.  She decided she didn\\'t want to be married anymore, she wants to live the single life.  Mind you, she just moved back in 9months ago (she had lived a year of separation with her hubby).  I\\'m not trying to judge you but what do you mean you want to live the single life?  She has fooled around on her hubby, she had a guy waiting in the wings for her...just say, I want to explore these other options.    Anyway...this new guy tells her he will call, tells her they will do lunch, etc and just doesn\\'t follow through.  9 times out of 10, he\\'s not following through.  Now, she wants to piss and moan that he isn\\'t following through (oh yeah, he has a wife and a baby too--though, I think they are separated, but not divorcing).  Finally, I casually suggested that she should just write him off.  I asked her why was she so drawn to him, they have only gone out half a dozen times.  She asked me what I meant...to which I responded, \"My little sis has taught me a lot about dating, should I ever be out there again.  If the guy doesn\\'t treat you right, if he doesn\\'t act like he should, or if the chemistry isn\\'t there, cut him loose.  Don\\'t beat yourself up about it, it is simply two people that are not compatible with each other.\"  Which should be common sense, but I know for a lot of girls (myself being one of them) it really isn\\'t...our emotions take over and the rational side of our brain goes on vacation.  It\\'s not that easy...is what she responds with.  I agree, if you aren\\'t used to that, it isn\\'t easy but it is the right thing.  So she says \"why do you think I\\'m so drawn to him?\"  Okay...lesson, if you ask me my opinion, I will be 150% honest with you....I try very hard to deliver it tactfully but I can\\'t make any promises, therefore, if you don\\'t want complete honesty, DON\\'T ASK!  To which I responded, I don\\'t know if this is true, but from what I have seen, you seem to like the falling in love part and the new infatuation...but once that part of a relationship is over you seem to check out too.  Yeah, I\\'m sure you can imagine, she didn\\'t like that so much but she said, You\\'re right.  I never thought of it like that before but it is true.  Dude, I\\'m really not out to be right...I just don\\'t understand why you must bitch about something you are completely bringing on yourself.  SOOOOO...she goes into how she and one of our friend\\'s ex-husbands are talking and she thinks he likes her...this is the SAME friend who dumped her best friend because she started dating her ex-husband.  She is actually contemplating what she should do!  She was the one who brings up, I don\\'t want to be like C and steal someone\\'s ex but what should I do?  Is this really a question???  You just answered yourself!  DON\\'T!  You couldn\\'t handle it so why would you risk a friendship expecting someone else to???  Lordy...stupidity bugs me...  Other than that...CP and I are planning a trip to Chi-town for the end of the month.  Nothing major, just some shopping, some clubbing, and then home again.  We\\'ll stay over one night but I am so excited!  K may come with us, though she gets very intimidated by large cities...so I don\\'t know if she will chicken out or not.  I so need a day away from everything...only a few more weeks!!!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nIsn't life strange?  The past week has been a continuous cycle of stress...and, now, that it is all over, I just want to forget all the stress, find the good, and move on!  We put Spike down.  Please, be kind with the judgements.  He was destroying the house and we just couldn't figure out a way to solve it.  I miss him, he was my puppy and I love him so much.  At the same time, I couldn't argue with hubby about how much stress this was causing and how angry it was making him.  Namely, our brand new carpet is now destroyed.  I guess carpet is much more satisfactory to tear up than hardwood floors?  He has not torn at flooring before.  Okay, correction, he ripped up some vinyl when he was new but nothing since.  So, he suffers from extreme nervousness.  When someone other than hubby, B, and I come into the house he freaks.  He will run and hide under the bed if our room is open and bark his head off.  Seriously.  For three hours one time because I couldn't pull him out.  Or, if I anticipate someone coming and close off the doors, I lead him back downstairs and he crawls into my lap while people try to let him sniff their hands.  Anyway, I am trying to justify what we did, I guess.  We knew that because of his fear he would be so scared and people would have little patience so we decided to put him down than put him through that.  I think it was the right thing to do although a few of my friends have voiced their adament disapproval.  Ironically, anyone that knows Spike agreed with us, he wouldn't have made it if we sent him away.  Regardless, I miss him very much.  It is better this week...part of me has acknowledged he is gone so the constant thoughts are winding down.  My inlaws...I don't even want to go into this.  I have spent the whole weekend arguing with hubby about it all and I'm tired of the control they have when we are trying not to let them have control.  As I told hubby, I am done seeking them out, I am done begging for a relationship.  They can live in TC with each other and live their twisted lives together.  I will continue to follow through with my obligations as their daughter in law but no more than is necessary.  The silver lining?  The shower is over...now, I know I will probably have to go up there once the baby is born but after that...I don't see any reason to interact until we go to the races...potentially two and a half months of freedom!!!  THAT is something to look forward to!  A plus side to this whole nightmare of a past week, I got a new car.  The Barto-mobile has been retired and I miss it.  However, there is nothing like the comfort of knowing when you turn that key, your car will respond appropriately without any screeching or squealing.  We were looking at a new truck for hubby since I cannot drive his stick and that way, when my car did break down, we would be able to share a vehicle until it was fixed.  Well, hubby decides since he is getting a new vehicle it must have all bells and whistles.  BUT it did not bother him that he wanted to buy a '97 Expedition...maybe I'm wrong but wouldn't it be beneficial to buy a younger truck with less miles and less features???  It won't mean a thing that your vehicle has heated seats if the stupid thing won't run!  So, everytime we would go look, we would get mad at each other.  Finally, I told him I was done looking.  We could continue driving the same vehicles until one died and that would be the one we replaced.  Now, don't get me wrong...hubby has been nagging me for two years to get a new car.  My car was paid for and I liked not having a car payment so I held off.  He won.  He suggested I look online for a car instead of a truck.  I found a car in a different state that was extremely low mileage and a great deal.  Plus, he took my car for a trade in.  He is also a cop so, of course, for hubby that sealed the deal.  It has been strange getting used to the new car but I really like it!  Other than that (!), this week looks promising!  B has an appointment with the etn dr today.  I am very hopeful this is finally the right specialist to tell us what is going on and how we can help him...my health is haywire as expected.  I am praying this is the right dose because I'm not exactly sure I can take going through all of this again in six weeks.  Did I mention my oldest sis is pregnant???  YIPPEE!!!  I'm so excited for her...and, now, I am trying to figure out what to do...go to NY before baby is born, after, next year, both???  Decision!  The baby is due at the end of November so maybe I should go at the end of the summer and then the beginning of next year.  Plus, I am wondering if she will be coming home before then so we can throw her a shower!\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nman!  Do you ever get nauseous?  I swear, it is terrible!  I don\\'t know what the deal is but it has been happening...it hits mid-afternoon and I just feel exhausted.  I feel so sick to my stomach and eating doesn\\'t help and not eating doesn\\'t help...yuck!  Monday night I put in a frozen pizza (very gourmet!) for B and I...well, he was watching \"Brother Bear\" and I passed out on the couch.  I never heard the buzzer so I woke up to smelly burnt pizza.  Thankfully, it wasn\\'t burned that bad and B ate it but still!  I don\\'t know how I slept through it...when B asked what happened I said, I must have not heard it while I was sleeping...he says, you must have been snoring so loud that I didn\\'t hear it either.  HAHA!  So who knows what the deal was...but same thing last night.  Thankfully, I thought before we watched \"Brother Bear\" and didn\\'t try to pre-make our gourmet meal.  Anyway...I am not so melancholy today.  I forgot something funny my stylist said yesterday.  She asked my if hubby knew I was coming and I said yes...is he excited?  I think so.  She says, \"Oh, you know he so is...it is every man\\'s porno fantasy.\"  I was laughing so hard...and yes, uptowngirl, I COMPLETELY agree...next time it is all gone.  She was just telling me she has not done much of that and the salon is having her attend more classes as it is becoming more common...so I figured it could wait until next time...lol!  So, perhaps in a couple months?    and yes, I think he was excited...he came home from work, skipping his running/workout, and tried to wake me up...I guess I was out cold so he just stripped me and I woke up to him on top of me...ahhh, what a beautiful way for a nymph to be woken...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nI\\'m in a melancholy mode...who knows why...just am.  Work is weird.  And to top it off, I have yet to hear if I was extended for July...okay, we are talking the day after tomorrow!  Ugh.  I\\'m not stressed about it, just annoyed.  I think if my PM\\'s were fretting I would get worried...I\\'m sure they would drop massive hints if something was up.  I went and got a wax today...I thought it would be a \"full removal\" but I called in and asked for the Brazilian...I thought that is what my older sis said that meant...guess not.  It means one finger width is still left...damn!  I was really looking forward to being hairless.  Next time.  Oh, yeah...I also had to buy some cream because I am VERY prone to ingrown hairs...$34 DOLLARS!  15ml for THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS!  I am shocked.  My waxer offered me the small packet but I took the big tub, I mean, who knew?  So this venture cost me $80 after the tip...that will thrill the hubby!  Tomorrow I am going to get a pedicure and then next week I will get a fill in my fingernails...who knew being a girl was so much work?!  I have been going tanning almost everyday...oddly enough, I feel tan today...  Will my period come?  I need to do the monthly dance...don\\'t get me wrong, skipping is cool...but I know I won\\'t be that lucky.  If I don\\'t have it before we go, guaranteed it will start while we are gone.  Yucky!  I\\'m going to go listen to Karen Carpenter...I\\'m in a mood...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nahhhh...what weekends...I love them...but it makes Monday mornings especially brutal...  Friday...B was at VBS all week and Friday night was parents night.  Both hubby and I went.  First a bbq and then watching them.  They sang and then there were \"Olympic\" games...what a cluster!  The leaders didn\\'t know what they were doing and the games were not entertaining even the youngest of kids!  It was an hour and a half of torture...we were SO glad when the games were over...but it was fun to see B so excited...he was so happy we were there and got to \"see\" him do his VBS thing.  After that, we ran to Sears to do some shopping.  Got B some clothes for soccer, hubby a swimsuit and some sandals.  Saturday morning we got up and went to Bob Evans for breakfast...yummy!  Then we continued shopping...yuck!  We went BACK to Sears...hubby didn\\'t like his swimsuit and I exchanged some flip-flops at Ann Taylor.  Then we went on to Dunham\\'s to buy B some cleats, shin guards, and socks for soccer camp.  Hubby got a swimsuit there...then on to Old Navy.  Hubby got another swimsuit and a sleeveless shirt...I found a tshirt.  Finally, we went home.  I told hubby, shopping with he and B is like shopping with two ADHD kids...they were constantly, \"Sar look over here, mommy look what I found, mommy/Sar, mommy/Sar\"  It was driving me mad!!!  I basically crashed when we got home...seriously...I was exhausted...got up, went tanning.  Why aren\\'t I getting tanner than I am?  Do you stop having the ability to get tan the older you get?  It is very strange...after that, we got ready and went to M & J\\'s housewarming/annual bbq party.    Their new house is beautiful...and a beautiful backyard and gardens as well.  M hired a woman to do facepainting and balloons for the kids...B had his face painted like a rainbow tiger, it was beautiful!  He looked like he was performing in CATS...seriously, it was awesome!  One of my friends, JL, was there...I haven\\'t seen her since they moved to Ann Arbor.  She and M kept going on and on about how beautiful I looked...it was so nice to hear the first time but then I was just embarassed.  M says, you look like a movie star!  You look so awesome!  Then she would say to whoever was around her, isn\\'t she just beautiful?  Her hair?  Her face?  Her whole package?  Just beautiful!  Seriously...I was mortified...  C was TERRIBLE!  He kept screaming because the kids were playing with his toys...duh...and, of course, M did nothing...J did nothing.  It was embarassing for them...and maddening for every other parent.  Hubby was so pissed by the time we left...I guess C had hit and pushed B a couple times...I only saw one push and I was all over him.  Hubby just could not believe M&J let him behave like that...it changed his opinion of them...I had told him this is how it was but he had never seen it before.  I doubt he will want to do things with them anymore...  Sunday...more sleeping.  I got up around 6:30am to make a list of what we need to do to sell the house...holy crap!  Not a bunch of \"big\" stuff but a full page, nonetheless!  We talked it over and decided to wait at least another year, probably two.  We have been looking at houses on a lake or have deeded lake access.  Hubby has always told me there was no way we could afford it...well, we can.  Not that it will be big and immaculate but the ones I found are a little larger than we have right now.  Definitely a realistic dream...I mean, if we don\\'t have anymore children, we don\\'t really need a larger house.  I would like a little bigger and would like a different floor plan but I am sure we will sacrifice some of our \"wants\" to be on a lake...both of us have ALWAYS wanted to be on a lake.  Man!  I can\\'t wait.  But this will give me something to strive for...and hopefully help get my spending under wraps again...lol!  Made a big breakfast for all of us...I don\\'t know what my deal is...I just want to eat pancakes...lol!  After that, I went to take a nap...then we did some quick grocery shopping and I bbq\\'d, or tried to.  Something is up with our grill because it was NOT cooking the meat.  I ended up having to use the George Foreman and hubby left late for work...ugh.  B and I watched \"Brother Bear\", I rearranged the kitchen counters, and that was the extent of my fun for the day...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nyippee!!!  I learned how to inhale!  Today was my first day back to running after getting an inhaler.  The dr said I need to have two puffs and wait twenty minutes...then I should be good to go.  Well, last time I had an inhaler, it did not work.  I could NOT inhale...sounds stupid, but it is true...same reason I couldn't learn to smoke in college, can't inhale.  Ironically, same reason Clinton explains he couldn't do pot or whatever drug, he could not inhale...anyways.  So, I wake up, psych myself up and did it PERFECTLY the first puff...it was so weird because I felt it.  The second puff didn't go quite as well, about halfway right...but still, quite progress!  Now, after taking a week off, I need to work up to where I was again, but I made it pretty far considering...probably tomorrow I will be able to pass this level and go to the next step.  Mary Kate...wow...can't say that I am surprised.  That girl was looking bad, worse than Lara Flynn...I don't really have much to say on the matter, just that I hope she is successful with the treatment and that she gets better...sending her all of my warm thoughts, along with many others, I'm sure...she is such a beautiful girl...I hope she learns to see that too...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\ndo you like to look back at how you have changed over the years?  It is pretty funny...I wouldn\\'t say I was ever a \"tomboy\" per say...but when I was in high school I so did not care about \"girly\" things.  Sure, I liked to be all glammed up but I wasn\\'t going to commit the hours that my \"girlfriends\" did to do so...I also didn\\'t care about appearances...I wouldn\\'t not play ball with my guy friends because I might get sweaty or messed up or dirty...  Now, I would say in the last couple years, I am turning into a complete girly-girl.  Not that I don\\'t do things because I might get dirty but I LOVE pink (AHHHH!), I don\\'t mind spending money on girly things anymore...actually, as of late, I have been in complete girly mode.  It started when C and I went to Chicago.  I got to go into Sephora for the first time.  Other than the madness of all the people, I LOVED it...but I couldn\\'t decide what to buy after about 35minutes so I stopped torturing C and just left.  Now, I wish I had gotten their las vegas makeup bag.  Too cute!  I could order it online but I think hubby is about to kill me with all the purchases as of late...anyway...so I have been obsessing about girly things...add in my extra hormones the past week...  I was in Target yesterday filling my inhaler prescription...I got some cool \"tools\".  I got cuticle clippers (I have been DYING for some for over a year!), eyelash curlers (I decided about 3months ago I needed some), and, finally, my new love, a callous shaver...I don\\'t know if that is the technical name but when I got the pedicure in Chicago, this woman used one to scrape off the nasty skin on the bottom of my feet...I was instantly in love!  I have been keeping an eye out for one but sephora.com was out and I hadn\\'t found any in the stores.  I can\\'t wait to use it!  Also, I have been wanting to stock up on more makeup.  Sadly, I have used the same types of makeup since college!  Appalling...I know.  SO, my friend started selling AVON and I decided to buy some stuff from her.  I know, not the highest quality but I need to figure out what I can deal with before I drop a buttload.  Also, I went to Marshall\\'s and got a bigger makeup bag that will hopefully hold me over until I find the perfect big one.  THEN I went on eBay and bought this CD...it is put out by MAC and is supposed to show different ways to apply makeup.  This is what I have REALLY needed...the nice girls at Merle Norman tried to help me when I worked across the hall years ago but I don\\'t really remember everything...plus, I would like some bold new ways to wear makeup...I cannot wait until it gets here!  Why am I feeling so girly?  In anticipation of my brazilian wax in a couple weeks?  Oh yeah, I also went and got an overlay on my nails last night...I\\'m a walking Hello Kitty...\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\ndo you ever feel like you are two steps from being committed???  that\\'s me...I always over-analyze myself, and, of course, it all takes place in my head...so, yeah, I think I\\'m nuts...  anyway...do you know how many pregnant people I know???  I know a bunch...I also know a load of people buying new houses...but that is not what I\\'m talking about right now...my older sis, her sister in law, her friend, my friend T, my PCOS friend A, and now S...not to mention all of those I know that JUST had babies.  It is weird because I would have thought that I would have issues with it...not really...I don\\'t want to say that I am above that because that is NOT what I mean...I just mean that I haven\\'t allowed myself to think there is even a remote possibility so I have moved on to find other meaning in my life beyond having babies.  I\\'m glad I feel this way...it isn\\'t like me to be jealous of what other people have so it was a double whammy when I got all depressed AND was jealous...I just didn\\'t like myself so much then because I felt I was just being bitch-y.  This weekend was nuts...seems to be the story of our life.  I feel like we are trying to cram in everything before we go on our cruise!  Friday, my parents had B overnight...hubby and I met his coworkers at Don Pablos for dinner and then went to Gary Fields Comedy Club.  We had never been there before and it was HALARIOUS!  I have not laughed that hard in a very long time...hubby was so nervous going into it because he thought I would not like his coworkers...I had met them at R\\'s graduation party and they were so nice...but I think he was worried they would talk about work the entire time and I would feel left out.  They did talk about work A LOT but it doesn\\'t bother me...I am so used to listening to hubby\\'s stories and not having a clear understanding of everything he is telling me.  Plus, R\\'s wife, J, is so sweet...they both are just very nice people.  We had a great time with them which was wonderful because since B and H\\'s divorce we haven\\'t really had a perfect match as couple friends... I take that back, we have T & J but they live in Indiana and we don\\'t do things without the kids.  Anyway, J said she will find the schedule and we can plan a next time...I think each side passed the \"friends\" interview...lol!  We went to the early show with R&J so we got home a little after 10pm.  My sis has loaned us the Harry Potter movies so we decided to watch the first one.  I fell asleep for about 1/2 an hour but we both really like it.    Saturday we both slept in, got ready, and went tanning.  The owner was there so we talked to him about the best way to get hubby tan in three weeks, not going everyday.  He was really nice and gave us a great deal on a package and some new tan lotion.  He talked to me about how it was going for me since I come everyday...I told him, for some reason, I still wasn\\'t getting much color!  That\\'s when he sold me a different lotion that has accelerator in it and upgraded my bed.  He says, you are going to feel it burn but you aren\\'t REALLY burning...  Well, he put me in the ultra-bed for 15 minutes...I was still getting pink at 10minutes in the regular bed!  And, boy, he wasn\\'t kidding!  That shit made me hurt!!!  It burned and was on the verge of hurting..it was definitely NOT comfortable!  Then, I got out and everywhere I had put the lotion on was bright cherry red...it looked like I had fried!  The good news is, I did indeed get a lot of color...the bad news is, there are places that really did burn.  Like the back of my arms, the top of my thighs, the sides of my calves...very weird but whatever...I didn\\'t go back yesterday but I think I might be okay to go today...  After tanning, we picked up B.  Then we headed to Cabela\\'s.  It took a little over two hours but it was such a beautiful afternoon.  We spent three plus hours there and both hubby and B had a fabulous time...it was not as painful as I thought it would be but I definitely could have left at least an hour earlier!    Sunday was just lazy...I got up and went grocery shopping...it took forever because I hadn\\'t gone for a couple weeks.  I have decided, I need to find a farmer\\'s market.  I spent the majority of the grocery money on produce, including the $6.50 I spent for a bag of cherries!  Unbelievable!  So, I\\'m thinking I need to find somewhere to get some of the fresh produce cheaper.  Plus, it would probably taste better because it would be extra fresh!  Anyway, we had a bbq for hubby for Father\\'s day and that was it...I crashed on the couch after lunch.  I was so tired...it is funny because I get irritated when I have to remind hubby that I can\\'t go balls to the wall all the time and sometimes my body just crashes...but I forget too.  I slept for about three hours!  Thankfully B wanted to watch a movie so he was content just laying on the other couch while I was dead to the world...  Well...my boss is ooto this week so I guess that is why I felt the need to ramble so long.  I don\\'t have much to do and am DREADING this week...I want to work extra so I have overtime for extra cash for vacation but I don\\'t know if I can convince myself to stay!  This afternoon I have to leave a little early, I have my hearing test...the results should be interesting...\\n\\n'"

"female"	"'\\n\\nlordy!  Please know, I do not purposefully put myself in the place of surrogate mother to my younger sisters...and sometimes my older one as well.  I have always thought that everyone thought I was crazy...I\\'m not convinced that my brother in law and older sis don\\'t but I finally feel like maybe my sisters actually appreciate my brutal honesty...   when I had the infamous \"talk\" I definitely felt ostracized...I mean, how DARE I suggest that they may engage in the demons of alcohol or premarital sex...but at the same time, I didn\\'t care...I NEEDED to say what I said for my own peace of mind.  Please know, I do not blame my parents for hubby and I getting pregnant before marriage, obviously, I made the decision to have sex.  BUT I think if I had not been as \"responsible\" and \"mature\" as I was, in some ways, I would have been a basketcase.  I think this is my issue with right-wingers...just because you teach someone safety doesn\\'t mean they ever use it...have YOU ever used a fire extinguisher?  Do we NOT teach how to use one because that would just be inviting people to start fires?  OF COURSE NOT!  In my mind, birth control and alcohol awareness is the same thing...please teach kids the benefits of using a condom IN ADDITION to using birth control...please teach them about AIDs and other not so fun STDs that they are risk of getting...please teach them about alcohol...etc...it is important shit that if they aren\\'t taught they will learn from experience, and perhaps, after it is too late...you can\\'t just return AIDs to the store from whence it came...my point, I guess, is that if someone had been more honest with me about sex and alcohol and drugs, maybe I wouldn\\'t have been so naive...maybe I would have...  Well, lil sis came to watch B for hubby and I...my mom usually has him in the summer on Wednesdays but since my uncle died, they were in Manistee.  Well, I get home from work and am talking to her as she is leaving...all of a sudden I see it, a HICKIE!  I was so shocked!  Now, I am even more shocked that I ever saw it...like I told hubby, it wasn\\'t like I was scoping out her neck, it just isn\\'t something I would have expected...plus, it really was not that big and she had makeup over it...well too bad for her!!!  It was pretty funny because I then went into my 50questions...who? what? where? when?  Of course, La was having none of it.  She just turned beat red...it was pretty halarious because it was like she saw my face the second I noticed the hickie and she turned beat red...so, I went to give her a hug goodbye and put her in a headlock...that\\'s right...I need to patent this move!  She literally was stuck smashed in my face for about 15minutes until I was laughing so hard I let her wriggle free...she tried tickling, which I\\'m not ticklish...she tried yanking and pulling but it was a HOT move...still didn\\'t get info out of her but, as I told her today, it is good to know I can kick her ass!  Now, I just need to defeat Lis and I\\'m back in the number one spot...trust me, I\\'ll use my new signature move, it will be the only way!  Anyway...I called her this morning to talk to her.  I wanted to make clear I am not disappointed in her...I mean, in the grand scheme of things, it is a few broken vessels...plus, in the back of my head, I know I have gotten them from NOT so innocent things...I\\'m not disgusted...I\\'m not really anything.  I told her again...please use a condom...please use birth control...but especially the condom...told her I just worry about her and want her to be happy and with someone that deserves her and treats her right.  Asked her if he spent the night (come on, this is ME we are talking about!)and asked about her birthday.  SUPPOSEDLY, she told him no to the ecstacy...I pray she is being honest, I don\\'t know that she would lie to me but at the same time, I don\\'t know that she would want to admit that one either.  Told her I love her...told her I was available for a beating anytime she needed it!  HAHA...yeah, she loved that one!  Almost as much as when I ask her if this car is a keeper!  (Note...this girl has totalled TWO cars...within 2months of each other--and 2months is a generous figure)  Did you know the Simple Life started again?  Lordy!  Those girls crack me up...hubby wanted to get very philosophical last week about it...they are so rude, they are disrespectful, blah blah blah.  I apologized but said I did not want to get into a debate...I was trying to watch OPRAH!  Anyway, yeah, I know what he is saying and I agree last season was a little much...but at the same time, these girls have never wanted a thing their whole life plus, I am SURE they are used to being catered to by everyone...I think this explains some of it...tangent!    Sorry...so, I watched both episodes last night...halarious!  I felt bad for Paris...who wants to forever watch on tv falling off a horse?!  But I love Nicole.  I love her new word \"hot\"...ie, no swearing in front of Kayla.  Paris says, \"nicole?\"  Nicole says, \"What? Oh yeah, that\\'s hot\"  HAHA!  Cut to her trying to get this little girl to say ass or bitch...too funny!  I have to give Nicole credit...everyone was SO rude about her looks last year...I think she is pretty plus she lets Paris have the spotlight and just rolls with it...it so reminds me of my friendship with S...I told her we need to pitch a spinoff where we roam around the states as two 20-something mothers on the hunt for a good time...I\\'m sure it would be just as amusing...\\n\\n'"
