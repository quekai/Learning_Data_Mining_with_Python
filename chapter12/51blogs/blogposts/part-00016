This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.

J\\'ai r\u00e9pondu \"ok, de toute fa\u00e7on, who cares\".   Elle m\\'envoie des courriels tout correct, auxquels je r\u00e9ponds l\u00e9g\u00e8rement.  Elle me fatigue.

"female"	"\"\\n\\nWow...it's been a while...so much has happened...including celebrating another anniversary of my birth...  But, that is not what I want to talk about...this is all very strange, so please bear with me...  Let's start with some background...starting in high school, early high school...I would get these premonitions.  It was weird at first, I would brush it off as coincidence...then, it just got freaky.  It was like a pit of your stomach feeling...something was about to happen, I would never know exactly what--not that detailed, but I would know something.  It became too often to be coincidence.  So, for high school and most of college, I paid attention to this and it was getting more precise...being able to tell who was on the phone, thinking about someone I hadn't talked to in a while and getting a call...knowing something was about to happen...freaky.  So, when I had a meltdown in Chicago and purged crap out of my life, this was something I began to ignore...I didn't have the energy it took.  So, a few months ago, some of my work friends went to see a psychic...the psychic told one of them she got vibes she was a wicca (SP?)...well, sure enough, this girl had some freaky occurences with a ouiji board...so, my birthday...one of the girls had debated between a psychic reading for me or some quarters for Vegas...she chose the quarters--Yeah!!!  Anyway...so, yesterday I was thinking about if I did go see a psychic...would she recognize if I had any sort of funky capabilities...which got me thinking about the fact that I really hadn't paid attention/noticed anything for a long time...  B and I get home...I check the mail and grab the newspaper...same as I do every single day...sorted the mail--mine, hubby's, crap...but instead of setting aside the paper, like I do EVERY SINGLE DAY, for hubby, I decided to open it up...once it was opened, I thought, there is nothing I really want to look at...so I just flipped through each section...looked at a couple sales fliers...and on the way to putting it on hubby's pile...decide to check out the last page...you know, deaths, births, marriages...WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I SEE!!!!! Mr X is getting married!!!!!  I am like speachless...I don't know which I am more aghast about...the previous shit or the fact he is getting married...I am just so totally weirded out...I talked to bf yesterday about it...she really is the only one who would understand and she vaguely remembers this shit from high school...but I just feel so weirded out.  I told hubby last night about the impeding marriage but had to laugh it off like it was no biggie...which it really isn't, I just couldn't tell him I was weirded out because he would want to know why, and, quite frankly, I don't even know why...  basically, I just needed to discuss some more and I don't really know what to say and needed to relay it out again...hopefully, it will help me be non-weirded...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nahhh...the ho-hum of life settles back in.  I have been relaxing, trying to have fun, and get all my crap done at the same time...not working so well!  I read \"What Dreams May Come\"...one of my fav movies, the book was pretty cool too.  It explained some of what the movie wasn\\'t able to cover.  I also read \"Riding in Cars with Boys\"...again, love the movie.  The movie was actually just about a mirror of the book.  I have really missed reading...my next is \"Tuesdays with Morrie\"...I have heard it is a good one, we\\'ll see!  For non-fiction, I am reading \"Exciting Careers with Sociology\" or something to that extent...before I commit to going back to school, I thought I would research what my possibilities are with my current degrees.  I have the Psychology one as well but haven\\'t had a chance to start.  Planted a dozen rose hedges this weekend...what fun!  I can\\'t wait to see them grow/blossom.  6-8 weeks!  I am now waiting for my miniature rose plants for mother\\'s day.  I am hoping they get here this week yet...I am going to my in-laws for the first time in a year and would like to bring them now.  My grandma bought an african violet for me...I am hoping I don\\'t kill it...my clover is not doing so hot...it keeps dying, coming back, etc!  I don\\'t know why...I think it is the feng shui bug biting...but I have a thing for plants lately.  Went to MI City on Saturday with my friend and both our kids.  It was kind of chilly but we had a good time.  Hubby didn\\'t scream at me about my purchases either...amazing!  We really have been doing so much better...I think that my resolve to behave mixed with my vacation has mellowed me...things aren\\'t as serious as I used to crack them up to be.  It is so much more fun to enjoy life than have your panties up in a bunch.  Tomorrow is  DAY ONE  of the infamous Pfizer take over...we shall see.  No news in the big K-zoo on what\\'s staying or what\\'s going...  Before I go...I LOVE PUNK\\'D!  It cracks me up!  This is so my sick humor...why didn\\'t I market that idea first?!  Halarious!\\n\\n'"
"female"	"\"\\n\\nwow...I really love calling in sick.  Hence, why I believe that I would be okay to not work...  Yesterday, we had to get the furnace maintenanced.  So, I decided the remote chance that the guy would have to come between the time hubby was gone and we weren't back from preschool yet, I should just take the day off!  Because of the time change, B slept until 10am...wow, that felt nice!  I decided to start painting the basement floor...hubby and I ate lunch, picked up B from preschool, took a nap, planted some flowers, tried out my rice cooker, read...what a productful day!  My heart is so not into work anymore...all I can think about is figuring out a cool job to have!  Hubby is talking about going to state trooper school...how cool is that?!  I am excited for him and am hoping to do the appropriate amount of nagging/encouraging to get him to apply.  One hurdle at a time...he is concerned about quitting work and not making it through.  I suggested that first he needs to apply and be accepted...he needs to get into shape so he can pass the physical test...then we can discuss the possibilities.  I have a big beef with a company that would not support a colleague to further advance.  In my mind, I would find it an honor to have someone advance to state trooper...a selling point.  Ahhh, but that is rational thought...not hubby's department!  Quite frankly, I would be okay if they won't let him take his legally approved personal leave, him turning in resignation.  Then, if he doesn't make it, he will be forced to find a different job.  Scary, yes...potentially financially straining, yes!  But worth it in the long run, hell yes!  I just want him to be happy and I know this is a dream of his...enter the nagging/encouraging...\\n\\n\""
"female"	"'\\n\\nahhh...still basking in the halarious memories of my trip...I keep remembering new things that crack me up...  okay, have you ever felt fake breasts???  While, I did!  Our friend Sandy at Studio54 had some amazing breasts, which bf was commenting on, she invited us to feel. BF wouldn\\'t but I figured what the heck?!  My, fake breasts feel cool...they are so firm with a little squishy.  I am seriously considering having implants just so I can feel them all day..okay, not really!  BFbugging our bell-guy, Pierre.  He had to be my dad\\'s age...and she just kept bugging...he told her he had kids, didn\\'t phase her... BF walking around without shoes because she wore stiletto\\'s in the airport...duh?!  Her feet were so hideous, I made her get a pedicure...understand, I hate feet to begin with...but these feet needed a makeover in the worst way...the pedicure helped a little...but they still need help!  Stan...this kid was halarious...think of Cody from that crazy friday night show that I can\\'t remember the name of...oh yeah, Step by Step...yet not so annoying.  At one point, he was yelling at all of us because we were degrading his IQ...he said that his IQ was \"Way Higher\" than all of us combined...so I said...you have a 50...he said \"at least!\" 50 is right above the mentally challenged level.  Chad...he was too cute...he told me that if he never talked to me again, to remember there was someone in CA that would drop everything in a heartbeat for me.  It doesn\\'t do me an ounce of good since I don\\'t know more than his first name...and I don\\'t remember where he said they lived in CA!  BF still thinks I will hear from him...I say, no way.  He totally would have called by now.  But he was so sweet, he definitely was on top of his game!  I just thought he was really cool...and not just because he liked me over BF...I am hoping that by the end of the month I will have just a vague memory of him...  Everything else is going well...B is misbehaving like mad, but hubby and I are doing so much better.  I think overall the vaca was good for my soul.  Seriously looking at graphic arts, with maybe some more english...I could do advertising or such and then start working on books...we\\'ll see.\\n\\n'"
"female"	"'\\n\\nokay...I am still trying to recover...but ready to spill the good dish...  Understand, my friend is very insecure...this is the only reason I can understand that she constantly asks guys if she is hot and flirts incessantly.  After about, two hours this gets annoying!!!  I am so the opposite.  Quite frankly, I don\\'t care what people think...I mean, yes, I want to look good, but who are these complete strangers to me???  So, I am very used to these type of friends getting all the attention...it is the people that look beyond that behavior that I usually mesh with...there were a couple people like that.  It is actually funny, I met more people that were severely annoyed by her than enamored by her...kind of karma for me...I don\\'t mind playing the back burner...I am very used to it!  Anyway, you get the idea...we can\\'t step outside of our hotel room without her trying to flirt with everyone with a penis.  After a couple days, I was tired of it...I told her I was on penis overload...there is nothing fun about having old, horny men trying to get all over you.  The first club we went to, there were these dorky hispanic men that were too old to be there who kept trying to grind on me...boners gross me out, especially when they are so obviously desperate!  I was getting so pissed at her..I kept trying to ditch them and she kept reeling them back in...she kept saying, At least they are buying our drinks...point 2-I don\\'t give a crap...I will buy my own drink, I don\\'t expect someone else to pay for it...especially when I know what they want in return and there is no way in heck they are getting what they want!  So I kept hiding out in the bathroom...and on one trip, she busts out and does a line!!! OHMIGOD!!!  I was not expecting drugs to come into the picture!  The freaks that were giving it to her tried to pressure me into it...hello?!  I am 26 years old...a bit beyond peer pressure, please!  If I was going to give in, I would have done that a long time ago...I don\\'t believe in using those types of drugs...alcohol effects your brain, I know..but that is as far as I go with an alternative state of euphoria...I\\'m a natural girl:)  So that kind of put me off too...  Also, we are in Vegas...did your hubby really believe that we would not be going to clubs dancing and drinking???  About every 3 hours, her hubby would call and need the blow by blow detail of what we were doing and what we had done since the last time we talked...drove me nuts!  Now, I understand that hubby and I went through some extreme situations, he has learned, I don\\'t like to answer to anyone...so he doesn\\'t feel the need to keep tabs...he trusts that I will do the right thing, and if I don\\'t I will get myself back into line...unfortunately, I broke that trust and I don\\'t really know that I should tell him...do I want to hurt him again?  At this point, I am trying to pawn it off as not a big deal...a little of it is working...a little isn\\'t...  So...it was Friday night...we had met Sara and just partied WAY too hard at Studio 54...we were going to catch a cab...my friend needed to go to the bathroom, so I waited...we were walking out when this guy stops her for a cigarette...of course, she starts flirting with him...by this point, I had gotten so sick of it that I would keep walking and eventually she would catch up...well, she didn\\'t, so I had to go back...by this time, she and Stan were sitting on a sofa type thing yacking it up...Stan had a friend...I was nice and said hi, but I think I made it clear I was not interested...but, watching her and Stan were like watching morons unite...halarious!  Two people that should never breed together, too close to brother and sister!  So, Chad and I started laughing about it...he was on the same page...so I figured I could just talk to him...he is from CA, cute, kinda short (just a little taller than I am) and exactly like Dave Matthews...he SAID he had a fiance...so I grilled him, of course she was tall blonde and beautiful...we just talked like old friends, my word, the majority of my friends until I got married were guys, so it was no big deal...I\\'m married, he\\'s engaged...we decide to go get a drink and so Stan and Sam followed...we were laughing and talking and forgot about Stan and Sam who kept making out...so someone mentions going to their room...I think, no big deal, Sam can get her groove on and I can keep talking to the most normal guy I have met out in Vegas...  We get to their room...not before making fun of Stanley Leroy Jackson, III who seems to be too drunk to remember where the room is!  and has the same birthday as I do...just four years earlier...there are two other friends in there...who obviously passed out after having sex...they were cool, they liked to bash Stan too...it was halarious... They pull out some weed...again, don\\'t do drugs, but I\\'m used to people smoking pot in front of me, no big deal...Chad opts not to as well...he thought it was \"cute\" that I had morals...yeah.  So, he grabs me and kisses me...I was completely taken off guard...i truly swear, I am the most naive person in the world...I had no fucking clue he liked me...I knew we liked talking to each other...well, low and behold, he is not engaged...it was a line...and, quite frankly, I feel like I am the only one who would fall for a bull shit line like that...I mean, come on!  So, basically, what it boils down to...I spent six hours with this guy, some kissing, some talking, a lot of making fun of Stan and Sam...he was so cool, so cute, so me.  I really felt like I connected with him...don\\'t ask me why or how I rationalized all of it, but I did.  Sam and Stan were in each other\\'s pants, though,  now she swears they didn\\'t have sex...not quite sure I believe that.  Chad was so nice about not pushing himself on me...he kept telling me to relax, I kept telling him I have a son...and that I knew I was being played...which I did and I didn\\'t...now I do, yet am still holding out hope he will call me...why?  Because, I feel like if we had met other than that way we would have been really good friends.  He left me with two monster hickies...oh so cool.  I flipped out...how would I explain those???  Luckily, they are gone, but I do feel like a jackass...and I feel like more of a jackass because I don\\'t feel more guilty.  My hubby funds this trip and takes care of B and I behave like a college kid...I swear to you, I am not meant to be married.  I feel bad for my hubby...I really do.  I feel like he deserves to know that he can\\'t trust me to stick around.  The only reason I didn\\'t agree to go to CA with Chad is because of B...that\\'s a little fucked up.  Anyway, I told Chad the only way I would believe that the entire night wasn\\'t about his penis would be if he called me...so here I wait at work...and, surprise, no call...yet, I am still holding my breath...how pathetic...\\n\\n'"

I thought I would write one long email...I am so exhausted, yet excited to fill everyone in...it was definitely the trip of a lifetime  Sam and I met in Vegas...we both took red-eye flights out on the 26th...we have been planning this trip for four months, so it seemed surreal that the time was actually upon us.  Both being moms, our gut reaction was to go home to bed, but we knew how lame that would be if that was our way of greeting Vegas...mind you, Vegas is three hours behind ET time...so, our bell boy recommended \"The Beach\"... unfortunately, it was college night.  We had fun though, kind of set the mood for the rest of the trip...if you could get past the girls in their thongs (the cocktail waitresses).  Thursday...Friday...Saturday...Sunday...I won\\'t recount the whole trip...we basically did not sleep until Saturday  night...we would take a couple hour nap and go back out.  It was great!  I really don\\'t know how we survived...but it was a blast!    The best parts...winning $25 in a slot machine made my week...made it not hurt so bad when I lost at roulette.  Gambling is not my thing...I am too \"frugal\" to lose lots of money.  I ended up playing nickel slots...does not induce much pain when you lose all of $2!!!  We tried blackjack..everyone at the table was so sweet and helped us out...  We LOVED Studio 54!!!  It was so awesome!  I am seriously thinking of marketing this here in Kalamazoo, there is nothing like it where I have been...even Chicago pales to this club!  We met a great girl...named Sara no less!!! Who lives in Vegas.  She was so sweet and told us she would get us in and up to VIP because she is friends with everyone that works there.  When we got there, we were able to bypass the entire line, walk right in...perfect timing...their show was just starting.  There were ladies hanging from swings, doing acrobatics to the music, amazing! We felt the music getting louder and faster...Sara told us to watch up...all of a sudden, two people jump from the rafters, with bungee like cords, bouncing up and down doing all kinds of flips, etc...crazy fun!!!  To top it off...Jennifer Lopez was there...and so was Pauly Shore!  Like I said, one of the hippest places to be in Vegas...I would fly out there just to go there!  We rented this adorable car...it was a little larger than a go-cart.  It goes up to 30mph and you drive it up and down the strip...it was halarious!  We gave a couple people a lift...it was so much fun!  We took it into parking garages....quite a reaction!    The Venetian...beautiful, beautiful hotel!  I spoke with several Italian people...Sam kept telling everyone I was Italian...very embarassing when they thought that meant I could speak italian!  Our gondola ride was fun!  I swear this boy needs to marry my sister...He had an amazing voice and was serenading us down the river (mind you, this is on the second floor INSIDE the hotel)...well, we were all laughing and having fun and he said that he had a special song for us...he pulled under the bridge and said he would have to sing VERY quietly...then he busted out with \"I don\\'t think you\\'re ready for this jelly...\" etc...yes, yes, he was singing BOOTYLICIOUS...halarious!  We were crying we were laughing so hard!  Anyway...you get the picture...we had the most awesome time, met a lot of cool people, came home exhausted, but hearts warm with many many memories!  It was wonderful to see Scott and Brennan, and I am sure the memories will brighten my boring days at the grind with the engineers who have absolutely no idea what Studio 54 is...(hint~a recreation of a club named Studio 54 in New York, which was big in the \\'70s)...

"female"	"'\\n\\nThis is so halarious...a friend emailed this to me:   MasterCard Wedding!   This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place  at Clemson University. It was in the local newspaper and even  Jay Leno mentioned it.   It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the  Wedding at the reception, the groom got up on stage with a  microphone to  talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming,  many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially  wanted to thank the bride\\'s and his family and to thank his new  father-in-law for providing such a lavish reception.   As a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to  give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom  of everyone\\'s chair, including the wedding party, was a manila  envelope.  He said this was his gift to everyone, and asked them to open their  envelope.  Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 glossy of his bride having  sex with the best man.   The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and  had hired a private detective to tail them. After just standing  there, just watching the guests\\' reactions for a couple of minutes, he  turned to the best man and said,\"F--- you!\". Then he turned to his bride  and said,\"F--- you!\" Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and  said, \"I\\'m outta here.\"   He had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While  most people would have canceled the wedding immediately after  finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if  nothing were wrong His revenge...making the bride\\'s parents pay over  $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception, and best of  all, trashing the bride\\'s and best man\\'s reputations in front of 300  friends and family members.   MasterCard wedding for 300 guests ...........$32,000.  Wedding photographs commemorating the occasion............$3,000.  Deluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in Maui.......$8,500.

"female"	"'\\n\\nIt\\'s so strange...I tried to pull up my archives, but for some reason, they cut out a large majority of my blogs...oh, to be internet literate!  Anyway...I always get a kick out of where I have been and where I am now...boy, was I a good case for some major Prozac!  I truly take myself a lot less seriously.  The scary thing is, I know that when I was starting to blog I had already come a long way from where I was...wow, I pity my friends and hubby from then!!!  What\\'s new...hubby and I are so much better...I am not sure what happened...I know I just got tired of fighting the same fight.  Are we perfect? Hell, no!  I know he will always have his issues, I will always have mine...the challenge is finding a place to meet.  Sometimes closer to you, sometimes closer to me.  We have been pretty successful with that dance as of late.  Friends...wow, I forgot about the \"falling out\" with my mommy friends...unfortunately, that did not change.  The main culprit emailed me a few weeks or so ago.  I never responded.  I am still hurt but realize people have different ideas of friendship.  I am just beyond the point I need to try to force someone to be my friend.  I want a friendship where someone is as invested as I am...and her friendship was not that way.  I did make another mommy friendship...but she is very, very clingy.  She wants to talk every other day...I HATE to talk on the phone...I swear it is from talking too much in jr high and high school.  She will leave messages \"I haven\\'t heard from you in a while...um, two days ago!!  It just bothers me...I like my space and independence.  BF...never heard from him again...and I don\\'t know how to get ahold of him...I love him, and pray he is doing well...someday...  Other BF...well, I just talked to her for about 20minutes after a little over a month.  Ugh...somethings don\\'t change and some days I have more tolerance than others.  I have been having some health issues and was trying to explain and voice my frustration...hubby and I have no give to our schedule...I have work all day, b all night...nothing gives.  \"Oh, that is the same way for me...\"  Umm, you just got done telling me you take them to the pool everyday...and your hubby is always taking time off to take care of them...or they are at the daycare so you can be home by yourself.  How is that the same???  I don\\'t know why this surprises me...nothing ever changes.  I just need someone to vent to about it...I am trying to stay upbeat about it, but it is hard to feel handicapped and see so many changes to your body and feel like you can\\'t do a bloody thing about it!  T...I feel terrible...this month has been horrible with Scott\\'s training schedule...so I have been acting like a hermit.  I haven\\'t called her in forever!  I got to talk to her for about ten minutes today...but that\\'s it.  I can be such a bitch...I really don\\'t know why I get that way...I think I would be quite content on a desert island with my family and that\\'s it.  Can\\'t wait for the weekend!!!

But what I was seeing wasn't that great.  It kind of reminded me of when they tried to get our senior class to have a jam session and talk about the school.

"female"	"'\\n\\nokay...I don\\'t usually comment on tv...how lame-0, I know!  But I have a few things I must get off my chest...  First...the Alias season finale...what was that about???!!! Do they think that I can wait until next season to find out why Vaughn has a wedding finger back on his hand...Sidney has been out of it for two years...and why they allowed Will to survive?!  I can\\'t...of course, thinking back...I also was the one who obsessed for months that they could not kill off Vaughn from the season 1 finale...if you don\\'t know what happened, a) you obviously have a life on Sunday evenings and b) are nuts for missing this show!  Anyway...very good cliff-hanger, but I don\\'t know if I can wait...  Secondly, do you ever watch the Bachelor???  This is one of the shows I watch because I love to laugh.  Just like sorority life...but that is a different topic.  Anyway, last night...Andrew wants Tina to open up...Tina opens up and tells the guy she is majorly falling for him...first of all, coming from a family of people who do not open up, that statement to him, and it was more like a long conversation, was huge for her, and is he too dumb to realize that?!  Just because she is not throwing herself at him or bad-mouthing her competition...then, after she did not receive a rose, Andrew walks her out...he is trying to explain they did not have enough time together, yadayadayada...  then, on his follow-up interview, he says, \"Even in the end, I was hoping to get her to open up emotionally, but she just never would\" (NOT an exact quote)...umm, hello??? You just dumped the girl on national television and you want her to sob to you about how she was falling in love with you...excuse me while I exit the area, there isn\\'t enough room with your head in the way!  I didn\\'t even like Tina much until last night...So we are left with Kirsten, who I am getting sick of her nit-picking on everyone...\"she isn\\'t ready for a relationship\"...this coming from the girl who had her boyfriend drop her at the airport on her way out!  and Jen, she seems nice...very real...as real as reality tv can be, i guess...  and while I am slumming it talking about the scary shows I watch...sorority life...like, if she, like, becomes, like, a sister, like, i don\\'t, like, want to, like, be one, like, too...okay maggie!  This show cracks me up...it is the epitome of why I have issues with girls paying for friends.  One of my non-payroll friends and I were talking (okay, really laughing) about it...this is what we summed up: a) sororities, not okay...all they do is cat fight and bitch.  There really is no point except to out-mean each other. b) fraternities...okay.  Reason being, they have two goals, get laid and get drunk (and not necessarily in that order).  No harm done there...no one will be forever scarred by having an angry mob beat up on them verbally because they didn\\'t curl their hair the right way. One of her \"sorority\" friends is so outraged by this show because it is so not like the way like real like sororities like behave...excuse me???  This is a mirror image of every sorority chick I know!  I think that deep down, sorority chicks are the most insecure girls...they are the ones that can\\'t make friends on their own because they are too scared to put themselves out there.  So they pay for these friends and they all empower each other and they become the bitchy group of friends they are...so, in a way, I guess sororities are good.  They give girls self-esteem...but at what price does the end justify the means?  And, yes, I do realize I am now psychoanalyzing an MTV show!  BOTS...I cannot wait for the reunion...Melissa looks hot!  And somehow, I am disappointed that Genesis and her wife are no longer together...Jamie looks cute with the long hair and minus the beard...  anyway...enough about tv shows...\\n\\n'"

Anyway, this morning I woke up at 5am feeling great...except I had a kink in my back.  I tried to go back to sleep but the kink hurt, so, I listened to my body and got my butt out of bed to work out.  Wow...it is so lame-o, but I really feel great now.  I haven\\'t been able to work out since Vegas...months ago!  So, to feel good, and have the desire on the same day was a mini miracle.  So, I did the A workout on my new Cindy tape and the first set of abs and arms/chest on the original Cindy video.  I didn\\'t want to push too much, knowing I have to survive a day at work and this evening.  But, I did 25 minutes...yippee!  Just a side note...watch Paradise Hotel?

So, my other friend called for something and i didn\\'t have it...and I just broke down.  How embarassing!  I am still trying to pull myself out of the funk.

It really seems so long yet only a few moments...so cliche, I know! but it is true...  Tomorrow is my big dive into the Weight Watchers club...fun, fun!  I was talking to my friends at lunch today...one of my friends, who I have suspected has a e.d., blew up...it was kind of comical, and insulting, all at the same time!  She said, workout...I said, I do...she said, watch what you eat, I said, I do!  People like her don't understand that not everyone who is fat is lazy...I guess I have been blessed with a life of diversity.  I have met so many people from so many different walks of life, I understand that everyone leads very separate, individual lives.  An event will effect me differently than it will you...unfortunately, not everyone is open minded or embraces diversity.  My other friend was really interested though...she has suffered alot of the similar things I have...she said her dr had mentioned PCOS but she never dug deeper.  I encouraged her to find out more...not for the soul reason of getting pregnant but just because of the health issues later on.  Just her reaction made it worth the other's.  I know I will face people like that for an eternity...and that is okay.  I feel bad more for them, than the discomfort they cause me.  I know what it is like to be closed minded, I used to be like that.  You miss out on life...you hold everyone else up to a certain standard, and yourself...no one can live up to that...and you spend your whole life frustrated and mad at yourself and those around you for failing.  Life passes by.  I am not sure why the mind change, but I can whole heartedly say, life is so much more enjoyable now that I don't take everything as a life or death circumstance.  There are serious issues, but not everything that arises is serious.  It is good to be able to sit back and laugh...I think I laugh the hardest at myself...

Went to the dr again...she said she can firmly diagnose me with PCOS...is that good or bad?  A little of both...from what I read online, I should be (and am) very thankful we got pregnant when we did...there is no guarantee I will ever be able to get preggo again.  That is hard...but, I was being told that and trying to deal with that without a diagnosis.  Hopefully, it will mean some help with the weight issue...it is hard being fat.  I have been on strike since I got back from Vegas...so now, I need to convince myself to get back into gear, eat right, excercise, etc.  Supposedly, there is a medicine they can give to me if they find out my body isn't dealing with insulin appropriately.  This medicine will force my body to deal with it and, thus, allowing weight loss...finally, maybe!  Trying not to hold my breath since I have been fighting a long and painful battle with this for three years.  But a potential end is better than convincing myself I am okay with this.  Frustration...why didn't the dr's recognize this before?  Why did  I  have to bring it up?  She said the symptoms have been there since puberty...it is just a matter of no one having gone through my entire file...they treat for what you are presently there for...whatever...I am just trying to find someone to be mad at.  Until my bloodwork comes back, she suggested I check into Weight Watchers...she said it will be that much easier when I do see a specialist and I try to get them to prescribe me Metaformin...so, I will dutifully check into it...she actually did not recommend Atkins...whew!  That diet sounds nuts!  She said she has been on and off it three times and, yes, she loses weight but then will gain it right back.  Weight Watchers describes better the correct portions and formulas for healthy eating...here I go!\\n\\n\""

Hopefully, the same plugs that I used on the broken one will just need to be put into a new one.

And, it proved to them that I seriously always run into someone I know when I go out.  At her party was this kid I went to middle school with...and we remembered each other.
