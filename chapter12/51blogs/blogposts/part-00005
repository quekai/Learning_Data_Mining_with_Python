Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages.

"male"	"'\\n\\nFrom a  Fortune  article by David Kirkpatrick:  urlLink Fortune.com - Fast Forward - I Get By With a Little Help From My Friends of Friends of Friends : \"There may be a new kind of Internet emerging--one more about connecting people to people than people to websites. The blog phenomenon, where blogs link to blogs, is another aspect of this same trend. Mark Pincus, an investor in Friendster and founder of Tribe.net, calls this the early phases of the \\'peopleweb\\'--a user-controlled network of identities and relationships that transcends any one site or company. How that web will take shape remains murky, but in the explosive growth of social networking we are surely seeing the future, using the Net to connect people with bonds of trust and friendship--and maybe sex. \"\\nAs I highlighted in a post below, it\\'s the communication, not the content.\\n\\n'"

"male"	"\"\\n\\n\\nIt's been a week since I got this blog set up, and nothing more posted. Yesterday I did some research on cameras and when I was in Winnipeg, I stopped in at Best Buy.  I was not intending to buy one, but rather just to look.  However, I am now the proud owner of a Canon SD110.  It's a funky looking   little   silver jobbie. I can actually get an underwater case for it that is supposed to be good up to a depth of 130'. My only complaint is that it only has 2X optical zoom.  It's 3.2 megapixels and I don't really want more than that, since that will be quite fine for sending you all pics, but I find I'm frustrated with the lack of zoom...so I may keep on looking.  Today was 'working on my bedroom, sorting out the clothes' day and tonight is working on my Visa night. The letter from the U of M, stating that 'who I was is who I am' has arrived, so that's a major hurdle jumped. (i.e. my married name on my degrees, which I have to take to Thailand with me, is the same person as my maiden name on my passport)  Now (aside from report cards at school and finishing up everything there and moving out) the next thing is to sort out Pharmacare and medical coverage for while I'm away.   Then, of course, there's all the renting out the house and sorting out how to pay the bills while I'm away and what to do about my mail and, and, and...\\n\\n\\n\""

Here are some sites that might interest you as well.   urlLink Lertlah School  This is my school\\'s site, or rather, one of them.  I\\'m teaching at the Petkasem (street?, road? avenue?) school. If you come to a site that is all in Thai, look in the top right hand corner for a small word \"English\" and click on it. It makes all the difference! :-)   urlLink Tourism Thailand  Probably more info on all the regions of Thailand than you ever wanted...   urlLink Learning Thai the Easy Way  Ok...that\\'s a misnomer, if ever there was one!  If I ever do find an easy way, I\\'ll let you know.  With 44 consonants, 32 vowels, and each of them capable of being pronounced in 5 different ways (low, middle, high, rising and falling tones), an alphabet that is incredibly beautiful but bears no resemblance to any letters we have ever seen, and no spaces between the words,  easy  is NOT a word that I feel can be applied to learning Thai.  Try looking at  urlLink Learn to Read Thai  You can hear some of the mistakes I\\'m bound to make at  urlLink Tone Bloopers . Be sure to read all the way to the bottom of the page. For an account of the troubles of one farang (foreigner), take a look at  urlLink Mis-Adventures in Thai Language .   urlLink Thailand Life  This site was begun by \"Gor\" when he was 12 years old.  He has continued it through his teen years and now makes his living at it. He is now a young married man with a baby daughter. The site has many photos of everyday life in Thailand...the food, stores, his initiation as a monk.    urlLink Sriwittayapaknam School  Gor started his website when he was attending this school.

"male"	"'\\n\\n\\nIt hit me at choir practice last Wed. night (June 30), several hours after I left school for the last time. I was feeling happily giddy and suddenly realized why.  I exclaimed, \"Excuse me...I just have to say,  \\'I\\'m retired! \\'\", and then uttered a victory cry. Great cheering from all...and right away I lost all the words to the songs and couldn\\'t concentrate.  Oops!  It was quite a last month, with an assembly at school for fellow retiree, Dolores, and me.  They sang two of my favourite songs,  The Tree Song  and  Child of the Universe , and then students from our classes danced the Maypole. It was enthralling and beautiful. The assembly finished with a tear-jerker goodbye song.  On June 24, the staff had a retirement party...what a blast! The highlights: --music by a local band,  Chaos  (members of my former church choir)--dancing and singing along --a Survivor game featuring Dolores and me --the staff singing a personalized version of \\'These Boots are Made for Walkin\\' (complete with appropriate attire) and \\'Happy Trails to You\\' (including one fellow riding in with a horse get-up) --incredibly touching speeches   Trying to vacate my classroom was a   real   challenge. I had to dispose of (or move home) years of accumulation of precious junk. I had a \\'classroom\\' sale, next put things up for grabs, then pleaded with folks to take things, and finally resorted to surreptitiously leaving things in mailboxes and outside doors.   Instead of a retirement gift, I asked that money be donated to World Vision for classroom supplies. They are able to turn $50 into $500 worth of supplies. So far, between donations and money from selling my \\'junk\\', I\\'ve raised over $700!   Thank you to all who helped!\\n\\n\\n'"
"male"	"\"\\n\\n\\nCarrefour, a small local mall, is pronounced Gahfoo by the Thais. We went shopping there to buy some staples. In the mall were vendors selling clothing, items carved from wood, and many other things. The supermarket is much like a Wal-Mart with a food section. We saw fruits and vegetables we've never seen before.  I'm absolutely astounded by how many things here are the same as in N.A.  I could even have bought Nutella (but I didn't, may I hear some applause, please...I was REALLY tempted).  Some things have the same name (like Nutella), some look the same but have a Thai name.  I bought Scott tissues in a 3 pack.  One of them has a snow scene on it.  I'm keeping it in my room to keep me cool!  And yes, there are post-it notes. :-)  The curious thing is the escalator. The supermarket is on the second floor, and the escalator is made up of small metal sections, about 4 inches wide, which fit together to form a slanted surface rather than steps. Then, when you've finished shopping, the shopping cart attaches magnetically to the surface and you can take it downstairs and right outside. Neat!!!\\n\\n\\n\""
"male"	"\"\\n\\n\\nHua Hin in a beach resort area a few hours south of Bangkok.  It has a wonderful beach area (think Grand Beach sand) with horses if you would like to ride, and chairs and umbrellas to rent for the day, which we have not done yet.  I confess that I still haven't been actually swimming, as I've been too busy with other things.  There are a number of things to see around the town and area, and Karen and I are moving rather slowly--trying to keep sweating down to small streams rather than rivers running off our faces.  Taking showers a number of times a day cuts down on sightseeing time as well.  Yesterday we scouted out the temple in town.  There are a number of buildings in a large enclosed area. One is a library, set up with Dewey decimal system (the books weren't marked...only the 100's above the shelves).  We found a section of English books, including Gone with the Wind, Mental Health, Readers' Digest, National Geographic, and some on hygiene and ethics for public healthnurses....all apparently very old.  The building was not kept up well in many areas...an old couch with the foam showing, things stacked up in corners, but a gentleman sitting at a table reading.  We found the main temple (obvious by the shoes left outside). People were buying bits of gold leaf to press onto a Buddha image (and 4other male images...more Buddhas?)  At one end was a hollowed out flat stone (about the size of a coffee table). People would press gold leaf into it, and some had left coins, which then were becoming imbedded into the leaf.  Some people would sit (mermaid style) in front of the Buddha, and shake atall cylinder filled with wooden sticks (which would rattle), and light Joss sticks (incense).  In the afternoon, we saw the old railway station.  It was built especially for one of the kings in the 1920's, and I don't think it's changed much since.  It reminded me very much of the railway setup at the Children's Museum or at the Manitoba Museum.  Got a picture of Karen going through what looks like a saloon door!  For supper we met Ev and Vic, and also the other Lertlah teachers at The Admiral's Head, a restaurant that serves what they think are the best hamburgers this side of Wpg.  After that, Karen and I strolled through the Night Market.  Some areas are regular stores, some are permanent booths, some are temporary moveable food and goods stalls set up along both sides of some of the streets.  There was quite a crush of people, and corresponding crush of sounds and smells.  I'm learning to bargain, and bought a ring that I think I will be very fond of.\\n\\n\\n\""
