This is 1.5 billion gigabytes, and is equivalent to about 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child on earth. Printed documents of all kinds make up only .003 percent of the total. Magnetic storage is by far the largest medium for storing information and is the most rapidly growing, with shipped hard-drive capacity doubling every year. Magnetic storage is rapidly becoming the universal medium for information storage...Although the social impact of the Web has been phenomenal, about 500 times as much e-mail is being produced per year than Web pages. It appears that about 610 billion e-mails are sent per year, compared with 2.1 billion static Web pages. Even the yearly flow of Usenet news is more than three times the stock of Web pages. As Andrew Odlyzko puts it,  \"Communication, not content, is the killer app.\"  \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaven\\'t been blogging much lately...a lot of work on my site and just started on a new project. Anyway, here\\'s my Takaful \"kad kuasa\" for the curious: &nbsp;       &nbsp; I have my reasons for keeping anonymous, okay...but the card is completely legit. Honest!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Howard Stern is making his return to Pittsburgh Radio - great. Now I am in no way a huge fan of Howard Stern, I don\\'t typically care for his show, but I do admire his principles, and I have been pulling for him since Clear Channel turned to Nazism. You see, to take somebody off the air because they aren\\'t making you any money - thats fine. To pull somebody off the air because you are afraid of the Christian Right, that\\'s fucking insane.   This was a real two for one deal, to be able to stick it to Clear Channel, and get rid of that annoying B-94 shit, in one bold move, it\\'s great. Thank you Infinity.   Is this good or bad for politics though? I mean, Stern claims that this will help Kerry, and that his listernes will vote against Bush - but really - is this good politics? Is there a class of Joe Lieberman democrats out there, a class of people that cares more about what you do with your life than what you to do other peoples lives? These people are clearly not going to applaud Howard\\'s overdue return.   Looking at Stern\\'s website, he has right up front - 18 months left in his contract. What do you think happens after that? Is he going bigger? Will the King of All Media ever find a kingdom?   In other news, Donald Trump hinted at maybe running for president. He actually said it is more likely for him to run for president than it would be to buy a major sports team. Do you think the Don will still be popular in 4 years - popular enough to make a serious bid for the White House? This is all trivial if Kerry wins, and Kerry will win.   In 4 years, the Republicans will have to either float a sacrifical moderate at Kerry, or they will have to pull out the big guns - Rick \"The Dick\" Santorum. That would be a fun election to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI write that title with trepidation because one isn\\'t a writer until one has been published. On paper, I mean. I guess web publishing makes you a writer, but that\\'s what I want to discuss. Recently I sent a script for a comic book to Marvel Comics. They\\'ve been accepting open submissions for a few months now for an imprint called  urlLink Epic Comics.  I also spent about twenty dollars sending it to them UPS next day. And in my mind, I\\'m certain my idea will be rejected. You see, I finished my undergraduate degree in History at the  urlLink University of North Carolina at Wilmington  in the spring of 2002, with a minor in film studies. After an internship at a public interest organization in Washington, D.C., I was (more) certain that I wanted to write screenplays. And that\\'s a whole can of worms. Honestly, who doesn\\'t try to write a screenplay at some point? It may sound like a silly question, but I\\'ve met so many people my age and older who think they\\'re creative geniuses. The difference between me and those people is that right now, I know I\\'m not a creative genius already. It\\'s going to take a while before I find out whether I can write a good screenplay. Or perhaps I could never find out and keep writing til all I was locked away. On that note, I\\'m applying for film schools. Not for screenwriting, but for production. Maybe that\\'s what the focus of this blog will be: my adventures trying to break into film and/or writing of some sort. Interesting? Probably not. But maybe it will turn into something. Meanwhile, I\\'ve got a bunch of applications to work on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAujourd\\'hui, c\\'est let\\'s bash Nat.  Ma coll\u00e8gue de travail a d\u00fb se lever du mauvais ovaire.  D\u00e8s que j\\'ouvre la bouche, elle me rentre dedans.  Un peu comme hier quand je disais que \u00e7a ne me faisait rien que le recteur revienne, mais elle \u00e9tait s\u00fbre qu\\'il ne reviendrait jamais (wrong answer!)  Un autre exemple des erreurs de Mme Je sais tout?  L\\'\u00e9cole Montcalm.  Je lui dit, c\\'est pour le secondaire, NON, c\\'est pour le primaire.  J\\'ai pass\u00e9 devant hier, c\\'est \u00e9crit en toutes lettres sur la fa\u00e7ade SECONDAIRE.    Ce matin, je dis, en joke, \"mouais, \u00e7a m\\'apprendra \u00e0 faire du z\u00e8le\" (je suis arriv\u00e9e une demi-heure plus t\u00f4t mais les ordi ne fonctionnent pas), je l\\'entends dire \"Franchement\".  Je lui demande si elle a des nouvelles du p\u00e9riodique en musique, elle r\u00e9pond super b\u00eate \"j\\'travaille pas chez Ebsco, j\\'ai fait mon possible, y\\'a plein de p\u00e9rio qui attendent qui sont plus importants\".  J\\'ai r\u00e9pondu \"ok, de toute fa\u00e7on, who cares\".   Elle m\\'envoie des courriels tout correct, auxquels je r\u00e9ponds l\u00e9g\u00e8rement.  Elle me fatigue.  Peut-\u00eatre suis-je simplement susceptible ces temps-ci, surtout avec tout ce qui se passe en musique, mais je ne suis tout simplement pas capable d\\'endurer ses mood swings.  Elle ne sera pas l\u00e0 vendredi et moi c\\'est la semaine prochaine, \u00e7a va faire du bien.  \u00c9trangement, je tousse beaucoup moins aujourd\\'hui.  Peut-\u00eatre suis-je en train de faire prendre mes distances, de faire ce que je peux faire.
