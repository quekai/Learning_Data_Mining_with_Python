However, I\\x92m not real  sure if I agree that such online or IT based knowledge communities are  real \\x93knowledge\\x94 networks that allow for knowledge building, or rather  if they are actually more to the tune of \\x93information\\x94 centers.  Velocity - the speed with which knowledge moves through an organization  (1)  Viscosity - the richness or thickness of the knowledge transferred (1)  Mobil Oil\\'s engineers developed some sophisticated ways of determining  how much steam is required to drill under certain conditions.  When  they applied their techniques, they found they could reduce the amount  of steam they generated themselves and bought from outside sources.   Since they knew the precise amount needed, the potential savings were  huge.  So they embedded the technique in an intelligent system, with  the main focus being the knowledge\\'s velocity in order to quickly get  the information out to the field.  This was done by sending a memo to  all the drilling operations detailing the calculations and benefits.   They assumed other sites would quickly adapt the innovation.  Nothing  happened.  The effective viscosity level was zero.  Simply improving a process will not be enough to win over everyone.  So  Mobil came up with some other techniques for transferring the  knowledge, such as videos and case studies and soon raised the adoption  rate to 30%.  It now looks as if it will grow to 50%.  Will it ever  reach 100%?  Who knows?  The resistance to abandoning processes that  have been successful for years is a universal phenomenon and is not  just limited to Mobil.  Velocity strips knowledge and information down to its bare essentials  by removing portions of its context and richness.  And this stripping  effect often takes the message down to the next level for its intended  receivers-- from knowledge to information or from information to data.   Thus the intended knowledge exchange fails.  Now look at how 3M does it -- they have regular meetings and fairs for  exchanging knowledge.  One of their most famous products, scotch tape,  was invented by Dick Drew...a sandpaper salesman.  In almost any other  company his idea would have been tossed out as tape and research were  not his specialty, yet the culture of 3M allows for the \"viscosity\" of  information to be spread.  And the way they ensure it spreads is  through meetings and knowledge fairs -- it is not left for a chance  happening on their intranet.  In the article, Professor Yamazaki writes, \\x93High-context based  communities in many Japanese companies have been gradually crumbling.\\x94   Perhaps this might be part of Japan\\'s problems -- the replacement of  communities where knowledge exchanges can likely occur with online  communities that often work better as information exchanges.  No don\\'t  get me wrong, both knowledge and information exchanges can occur in  either type of community, however, it is easier to exchange knowledge  in certain types of environments.  Being online allows one to gather a lot of information, yet the vary  nature of it \\x96 speed, works against it as being a knowledge-enabler.   Knowledge requires rich sources and context.  For example, one of the  best knowledge-enablers for a beginning learner is apprenticeship as it  allows a rich exchange of concepts and ideas between the learner and  teacher.  As one starts to slowly move away from this form of learning,  the knowledge exchange slowly starts to decrease, while the rate of  information flow increases.  That is, in a class, the information is  going out to a number of learners at once, hence the speed of  information exchange increases; however, the flip-side is that  one-on-one interactions decrease, thus the rate of knowledge transfer  decreases.  This is the first dimension of the  data/information/knowledge continuum \\x96 Viscosity/Velocity.  The second dimension of the data/information/knowledge continuum is the  number of paths or streams of information flow.  A single email  (monophonic) sent to a direct report is one stream, where as this list  normally has multiple posts (context) to each thread.  The more posts,  then the more viewpoints one can gather or harvest.  Once a learner  moves past the beginner stage, then these multiple viewpoints start to  become invaluable as they add context to the knowledge base that one  has gained.  For example, A PhD student studies one small section of  his or her field, but does so from multiple contexts.  There is a diagram showing these various relations at: http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/km/knowledge2.jpg  Throughout the various Knowledge Communities and Communities of  Practice, there are different levels of information and knowledge  exchanges.  So how does one determine if the community is mainly an  information exchange or a knowledge creator or builder?  What practices  have to be put in place to raise a information exchange to a knowledge  exchange?  For example, in Professor Yamazaki\\'s PowerPoint slide, there  is a facilitator for helping with the \"stroking\" of the members.  Is  this enough to ensure the exchange of knowledge?  Another example is  this list -- when does it help to build or exchange knowledge rather  that just exchange information?  Must there be participation or can one  just read the postings and become knowledgeable?  Or are they simply  becoming \"informed\\'?  NOTES 1. Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak (2000). \"Working Knowledge.\"  Cheers, and thanks for the excellent article!

And one of the main appeals of RSA and DSA authentication is the promise of being able to establish connections to remote systems without supplying a password. The keychain bash script makes handling RSA and DSA keys both convenient and secure. It acts as a front-end to ssh-agent, allowing you to easily have one long-running ssh-agent process per system, rather than per login session.
