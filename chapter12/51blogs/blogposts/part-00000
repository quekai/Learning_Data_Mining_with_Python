I've always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community.  You could build all these really cool places but people couldn't interact in them.  You also couldn't easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages.  I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista?) but it didn't as far as we would have liked.  Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems.  It's not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance.\\n\\n\\n\""

Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience.

Working on an airplane or from a caf?just felt wrong.    This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If you've used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I'm talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you won't go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I've stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I can't choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all.    And it keeps on getting better. 802.11 isn't just a technology, it's a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If you're in a major city, chances are you'll find one before you go a block.

I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations.   Wednesday night.  Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen. The theme of this international digital media festival was the \"4-D challenge\", to go beyond the third dimension. I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension. Now that I\\'ve spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself.  The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions. There was a soir\u9591 before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle. Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly. I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool. Business cards flowed like water.\\n\\n\\n'"

And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhan's meaning has been reduced to a one-liner. This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhan's literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught.\\n\\n\\n\""

Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three.

To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Baker's racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on it's side to maximize the space. Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully.

No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system.
