At least 52 people have been killed in a jail in northern Brazil today in a bloody conflict between rival gangs that left 16 decapitated, an official has confirmed.
The 'rebellion' began at around 7am in the Altamira Regional Recovery Center, in the northern Pará state, where gang members from one prison block invaded the prison annex and reportedly set part of it on fire. 
Sixteen of the dead were decapitated in the bloody five-hour-long clash that ended around midday (3pm GMT), an official from the Para state government's penitentiary department said.

Military police were called to the scene and negotiated with the inmates who had barricaded themselves in a cell block. 
Brazilian media have reported that two prison officers were taken hostage in the conflict but were eventually freed following negotiations with civil police and the state's Prosecutor's Office. 
Two correctional officers were held hostage during the riot and later released. Sixteen of the dead were found brutally beheaded
The riot comes exactly two months after 55 people were confirmed dead in a riot in the northern Amazonas state of Brazil in May
