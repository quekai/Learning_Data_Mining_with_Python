"I also found ... most chilling the fact that the special counsel confirmed the Russians have never stopped their interference. They're at it again," Schiff said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
"And he is desperately concerned, as I am as well, that the acceptance of foreign help, the willingness to receive it, may become a new normal under this president. And that, as the special counsel said, ought to alarm every American." 
Mueller testified last week in front of the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees on the findings outlined in his 448-page report. 
"The special counsel made it very clear that the Trump campaign welcomed Russian help, built it into their campaign plan, never reported it, made full use of it and then lied about it and that there were multiple acts by the president that constitute obstruction of justice," Schiff said. 
"about the message of taking an impeachment case to trial, losing that case, having the president acquitted and then having an adjudication that this conduct is not impeachable." 
"So there’s not a simple answer here," he said. "But the jury I'm most worried about, not the senate ... is the American people. Can we make the case to the American people? And I want to make sure that that's true before we go down this path."
