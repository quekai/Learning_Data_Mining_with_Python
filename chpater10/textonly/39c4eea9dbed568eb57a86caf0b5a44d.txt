City council approved $60 million in budget cuts late Tuesday night, including cuts to bus and CTrain service, fire services and affordable housing.
Council first elected to slash budgets after facing an uproar in June from small business owners. Commercial properties in neighbourhoods outside the core have faced steep tax hikes since 2015 as a knock-on effect of property values plunging in the downtown.
It should be noted that, in trying to sell the arena deal as a good one for taxpayers, Calgary is claiming it will recoup nearly $160 million in increased property taxes as a result of the arena revitalizing the neighborhood. So it seems a little strange to this observer to counteract lowered property values by slashing budgets at the same time it claims that property values will be skyrocketing soon.
Tombe observed that if the city wanted to guarantee it would get back $155 million, it could have simply demanded it as a target in the arena deal rather than rely on rosy projections. He noted that the Oilers’ arena deal with Edmonton requires the ticket tax to amount to $125 million over 35 years, and readjusts the fee each year in order to stay on track. (Currently, it’s at 9.5 percent.)
Tombe also noted that the money recouped from Calgary arena’s ticket tax is somehow less than what the city proposed in 2017 negotiations, while at the same time the city’s spending on the arena is even higher this time around.
