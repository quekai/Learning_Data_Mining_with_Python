Every day of the three-week long tour, a train of open-backed vehicles – stretching several kilometres in length – entertains the crowds and millions upon millions of freebies are thrown out to spectators ahead of the arrival of the cyclists themselves. 
The range of trinkets is broad, with companies flinging bottles of water, key rings, cycling hats, plastic rain ponchos, bumbags, wristbands, badges, toys, biscuits, sweets, and even samples of washing powder, most of which are made out of, or are wrapped in, plastic. 
The route from Brussels to Paris, via the Pyrenees and the Alps, in what has been dubbed "the highest race in history". 
After Dylan Groenewegen crashed in the final 2km, his Jumbo-Visma teammate Mike Teunissen took up the charge and pipped Peter Sagan on the line to win both the stage and the yellow jersey. 
Team Ineos set the early pace but Jumbo-Visma produced a stunning ride to double down their control of the yellow jersey. 
Julian Alaphilippe's late surge earned him an impressive stage win and the first chance to wear the yellow jersey in his career. 
The sprinters got themselves in position and Quick-Step's Elia Viviani came out on top on the streets of Nancy.
Bora-Hansgrohe worked as a team to carry Peter Sagan over the rolling Vosges hills and into the finish where he was too strong for the rest. 
Dylan Teuns held on to win an epic stage as Giulio Ciccone finished second and claimed the yellow jersey. Geraint Thomas impressed, finishing fourth.
The longest stage was not a thriller, but Dylan Groenewegen impressed as he clinched the sprint finish.
Thomas De Gendt stormed to a memorable solo victory, holding off the chase of Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot by a few seconds.
A little lumpy but no serious climbs, meaning the best pure time-triallists – Rohan Dennis, Serge Pauwels, Bob Jungels – will be eyeing the chance to win a stage. 
One of the most eye-catching stages of the Tour, with the Col du Soulor draining the legs before the legendary Col du Tourmalet, with a summit finish where all the big climbers – like Geraint Thomas, Vincenzo Nibali, Nairo Quintana – will all want to claim a famous victory. 
One of the toughest days of the Tour, with more hard climbing and more tests for those in the hunt for the yellow jersey. The final 75km contains three category one climbs, finishing atop Prat d'Albis. 
Some relief for weary legs as the peloton comes down from the mountains to take a far more leisurely ride around the south of France. The flat finish into Nimes, where the stage also starts, is tempting for any sprinters who survived the Pyrenees, if their team can carry them to the front of the race. 
A first taste of the Alps. Through the Rhone Valley and on to Gap, this is not an easy stage with plenty of gentle but long inclines and the sharp Col de la Sentinelle inside the final 10km which stands between any breakaway and a stage victory. 
This is likely to be a decisive day in the battle for the yellow jersey, with the famous Col de Vars, Col d'Izoard and Col du Galibier, all peaking above 2,000m. They are long and steep, with fast technical descents, and the winner of this Tour de France is going to have to withstand plenty of pressure on this day. 
A shorter day but still difficult, with a summit finish in Tignes coming after the monstrous Col de l'Iseran, the highest paved road in Europe.
The final Alpine stage is another brutal one, with the huge 33.4km drag up to Val Thorens to finish once again above 2,000m for the third time in this Tour, something never done before. This is a Tour de France which will be won in the clouds around the Alps, and if the yellow jersey can beat his rivals to Val Thorens he will have clinched the race victory.
The procession to Paris will offer any remaining sprinters one last chance for glory, and the opportunity for the race winner to sip champagne after a tough three weeks.

Many advertisers are long-term members of the Tour caravan, and the event is a key marketing opportunity. Other advertisers include Bic pens, St Michel biscuits and tyre manufacturer Continental.
They say that a few years ago it was 18 million, but the environmentalists say the “Tour de Plastic” has to do more.
Mr Lambert is one of 30 legislators who, together with six charities including Zero Waste France and Surfrider Foundation Europe, have written an open letter to the Tour’s organisers calling for action.
He also pointed out that petrochemicals company Ineos has become one of the newest sponsors of a cycling team in the Tour, and produces a vast amount of plastic.
Mr Kirby said: “It’s also time for the stranglehold of plastic manufacturers to end. You can’t ignore the fact that Ineos is emblazoned all over this year’s Tour as a sponsor of one of the biggest teams but at the same time a producer of huge amounts of plastic each year, and is only looking to increase production.”
“But our focus should be on the big corporate polluters, rather than the sporting bodies such as the Tour organisers. The companies are the ones profiting from plastic products. Then we all pay – for the cleanup, and in the damaged nature of our world.
“The Green Party is calling for a ban on all unnecessary single-use plastics, which is nearly all of them on the high street (and on the cycle routes).
“Far too often focus is put on expecting individual consumers to take action, but they aren’t the problem – the producers who profit from the products are.”
