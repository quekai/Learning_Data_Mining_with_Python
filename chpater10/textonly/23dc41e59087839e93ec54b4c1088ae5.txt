Documents obtained under Queensland freedom of information laws show the state Department of Environment and Science believed the Darling Downs miner had committed a âmajorâ breach of environmental laws.
A formal âdecision memoâ detailed that the mine had conducted exploration drilling activities â including drilling at 27 sites and prepping 41 more â on land not designated for mining activity.
âThe impact of the offence is major due to the high level of public concern regarding the New Acland coalmine (and the) risk of temporary impact to the environment,â the decision memo stated.
The memo showed the department believed that the $3,152 fine â a 20th of the maximum fine for a single infringement â would serve as a deterrent. The companyâs parent New Hope Group made $160m in after-tax profit in the six months to January 2019.
Details of the investigationâs findings and the fine were never made public â by the state or the miner â and have been uncovered in a tranche of documents obtained by the environmental group Lock the Gate.
A Lock the Gate Queensland spokeswoman, Ellie Smith, said: âThis latest paltry fine, kept secret by the department, will do nothing to stop New Hopeâs irresponsible behaviour.â
The documents detail how New Hope Group had increased production at the mine to meet supply contracts, and that as a result blasting and loading operations were being conducted with 200 metres of adjacent landholders.
During state estimates hearings last week, the Queensland mines minister, Anthony Lynham, said a decision on a water licence would be made by the end of September, but he gave no timeline for the final approval of a mining lease. Lock the Gate argues that should not be granted until all legal processes are completed.
The $3,152 fine for illegal drilling related to exploratory bores within the boundaries of the companyâs operational mining leases, but outside the area designated for mining activity in the mineâs plan of operations. The documents show New Acland argued that its plan of operations noted that exploration drilling would occur, and that it was âoverly restrictive and pedanticâ to be required to identify precise locations.
The departmentâs decision memo said the breach of the Environmental Protection Act was âindisputableâ.
Smith said the minerâs activities were having a detrimental impact on farmers and local residents. âThe people of Oakey and Jondaryan are fed up, and are worried that is the New Acland stage three expansion goes ahead, local businesses will go into terminal decline.â
A farmer from nearby Mount Darry, Desley Spies, said: âNew Hope is treating the farmers of our region very poorly, despite the fact we produce food and fibre here on the Darling Downs which Queensland relies on.
âThe farming land around Oakey is classed in the top 1.5% in Queensland. It is madness that it should be destroyed for the sake of a temporary coalmine.â
