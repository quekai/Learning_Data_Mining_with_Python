Romania's police chief has been fired over his handling of the murder of a 15-year-old girl, after it was revealed she made three emergency calls to report her own kidnapping, at one point screaming "he's coming, he's coming".
The girl was snatched on Wednesday as she tried to hitchhike home to Dobrosloveni in southern Romania
She called emergency services three times on Thursday morning, but police did not execute a search warrant for 19 hours
A 65-year-old suspect, who police believe may have killed a second teenager, was taken into custody on Saturday
Critics allege that officials failed to take the alert seriously and finally reacted too late to help save the teen, identified as Alexandra.
The girl was snatched on Wednesday (local time) as she tried to hitchhike home to Dobrosloveni in southern Romania, police said.
On Thursday morning, she managed to ring the emergency number 112 three times and provide clues to police about the place in which she was being held by a car driver who had picked her up.
Three buildings were searched by officers before they finally found the house where she had been held, more than 12 hours after her phone calls.
Police then sought a search warrant, which is not required in emergencies, and waited until dawn to enter the house â€” 19 hours after the teenager's last call.
A 65-year-old suspect, identified as Gheorghe Dinca, was taken into custody on Saturday (local time) after investigators searching his home and garden discovered human remains and jewellery belonging to the girl.
The suspect insisted he was innocent and had never met the teen but failed to explain why she had used his phone, his lawyer said.
Police believe a second teenager, whose parents reported her missing in the same area three months ago, may have been murdered by the same killer.
