Sergeant Matt Tonroe, an SAS sniper from Manchester became the first British soldier to be killed while fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) in an operation in Syria last March.
He died alongside US commando Master Sergeant Jonathan J Dunbar while on a joint operation with American special forces.
The Pentagon initially attributed their deaths to the detonation of an improvised explosive device in Manbij, northern Syria but an investigation has now determined that Sgt Tonroe was killed accidentally.Â 
"It was initially believed that Sgt Tonroe was killed by enemy action, however subsequent investigation concluded that Sgt Tonroe was killed by the accidental detonation of explosives carried by coalition forces,â A Ministry of Defence spokesman said.Â 
The sniper was working as part of a global coalition force against Isil, supporting local groups fighting Islamic militants in Syria.
According to reports Sgt Tonroe was on a secret mission to capture or kill high-value personnel from Isil when he died. Five other people were injured in the blast. It is not known if the target of the mission was captured or killed.Â 
"We mourn his loss dearly, are proud to have known him and will honour him by continuing this fight,â his commanding officer said.Â 
Sgt Tonroe was happiest when âprofessionally tested on operationsâ according to the Ministry of Defence. His was deployed numerous times on operations to Afghanistan and the Middle East during his service.
At the time of his death, Gavin Williamson, the former Defence Secretary said Sgt Tonroe served his country with great distinction.Â
