In the track, titled "The 1975," Thunberg recites an essay over ambient music, urging listeners to join a popular rebellion against climate change.
Thunberg says a decisive effort is needed to prevent "unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people," and calls for plain speaking about the scale of the disaster facing the planet.
"Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that homo sapiens have ever faced," she says.  
"The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases."
The track will form part of The 1975's upcoming album "Notes on a Conditional Form," scheduled for release in August.
The letter was co-signed by 24 scientists and published ahead of a meeting of the United Nations' International Law Commission.
