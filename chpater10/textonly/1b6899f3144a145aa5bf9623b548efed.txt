                    HMS Duncan in the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route in the Gulf
                
A second Royal Navy warship has arrived in the Gulf to protect British ships amid heightened tensions in the region.
HMS Duncan has joined frigate HMS Montrose to escort vessels sailing under the British flag through the Strait of Hormuz.
HMS Montrose has so far accompanied 35 vessels through the strait, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK continued to push for a diplomatic resolution to the situation.
He said: "Freedom of navigation in the Strait of Hormuz is vital not just to the UK, but also our international partners and allies. 
Mr Wallace added the Royal Navy will continue to provide a safeguard for UK vessels "until this is the reality".
HMS Duncan is a Type 45 Destroyer which the Royal Navy describes as "among the most advanced warships ever built".
Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was captured after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft.
But the then foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was seized in Omani waters in "clear contravention of international law" and then forced to sail into Iran.
Stena Bulk said the 23 crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, are in good health and have met with officials from their respective countries.
Speaking to the BBC, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith described the UK-flagged ship's capture as a "major failure" by the UK.
The then defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News "it is impossible simply to escort each individual vessel".
He said Iran guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and insisted its action were to "uphold international maritime rules".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has indicated the Stena Imepero could be released if the UK returns the Grace 1.
