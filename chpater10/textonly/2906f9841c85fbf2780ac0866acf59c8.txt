Prime Minister Modi will be seen in a new avatar on August 12 when he appears on the Man vs Wild television show, going on an adventure in the wilderness of forests in India.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be seen in a never-seen-before avatar on August 12 when he ventures into the wilderness of Uttarakhand along with Bear Grylls, the host of the popular television show 'Man vs Wild' on Discovery Channel.
The Discovery Channel has issued a statement saying the special episode featuring survivalist and adventurer Bear Grylls and shot in the India's Jim Corbett National Park, will be a "frank and freewheeling journey".
The Man vs Wild episode will premiere on August 12 and will be showcased in more than 180 countries across the world on Discovery network of channels.
In another scene, PM Modi is seen welcoming Grylls to India and holding up a weapon carved out of bamboo and other material collected from the forest and saying, "Main aapke liye isko mere paas rakhunga (I will keep this with me for you)."
To this, Grylls replies with a laughter, "You are the most important man in India, my job is to keep you alive."
The show has been shot as a means to promote awareness on animal conservation and environmental change.
"For years, I have lived among nature, in the mountains and the forests. These years have a lasting impact on my life. So when I was asked about a special programme focussing on life beyond politics and that too in the midst of nature I was both intrigued and inclined to take part in it," the PM said in a statement.
"For me, this show presents a great opportunity to showcase to the world India's rich environmental heritage and stress on the importance of environment conservation and living in harmony with nature. It was a great experience spending time in the jungle once again, this time with Bear, who is blessed with indefatigable energy and quest to experience nature at its purest," he added.
