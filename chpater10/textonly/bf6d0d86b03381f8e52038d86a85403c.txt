A UK soldier who died in Syria fighting the Islamic State group was killed by friendly fire, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.
However, the MoD said the 33-year-old died as a result of "explosives" carried by allied American forces. 
He died alongside US commando Master Sgt Jonathan J Dunbar while on a joint operation with American special forces.
But an investigation into the blast in Manbij, northern Syria, has concluded Sgt Tonroe was killed by an explosive carried by a colleague.
He joined the 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in Colchester on completion of his training, where he served as part of the Sniper Platoon.
A MoD spokeswoman added: "Sgt Matt Tonroe died from blast injuries caused by an explosion during a military operation.
"It was initially believed that Sgt Tonroe was killed by enemy action, however subsequent investigation concluded that Sgt Tonroe was killed by the accidental detonation of explosives carried by coalition forces.
