Activists blocked train doors on Tuesday, playing havoc with services and forcing hundreds of people to stream out of railway stations in search of alternative transport.
Protests have been taking place almost daily, sometimes with little notice, piling pressure on Hong Kong's beleaguered government and stretching the city's police force, which some have accused of using excessive force.
"We don't know how long we are going to stay here, we don't have a leader, as you can see this is a mass movement now," said Sharon, a 21-year-old masked protester who declined to give her full name.
"It's not our intention to inconvenience people, but we have to make the authorities understand why we protest. We will continue with this as long as needed."
Rail operator MTR Corporation said some services had been disrupted and urged people to use other forms of transport.
Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997, is embroiled in its worst political crisis for decades after two months of increasingly violent protests.
The latest protest follows a demonstration at the Chinese-ruled city's international airport on Friday and violent protests at the weekend, when activists clashed with police who fired rubber bullets, tear gas and sponge grenades - a crowd-control weapon.
Minor scuffles broke out between protesters and commuters as some grew frustrated over the train stoppage.
"It's so inconvenient and annoying, really. I am in hurry to work, to make a living. Will you give away your salary to me?" said one 64-year-old man.
