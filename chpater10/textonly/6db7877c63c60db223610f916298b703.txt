HOT WEATHER broke records last week but then at the weekend dipped back to cooler temperatures. Now the heat may return, with three Saharan heatwaves predicted to bring 35C (95F) scorchers.
Thursday, July 25, was the hottest day since records began with a temperature of 38.7C (101.66F) recorded at Cambridge University Botanical Gardens.  This was only the second time ever that the temperature had exceeded 100F in the UK. Many revelled in the heat - visiting beaches, swimming pools and parks and indulging in ice cream. 
“In a few places, there is the potential for 30 mm (1.1 inches) of rain to fall in an hour or two and 40mm (1.5inches) to fall in three hours.”
Met Office forecaster Neil Armstrong said: "From August 10 to 24, temperatures are likely to be above average and hot weather on the continent may spread in at times. 
MeteoGroup forecaster Matt Dodson also said: "The 30s are probable again in August, with southerly winds coming back.”
