The woman’s family said they believed Mr Sengar, who is in prison awaiting trial for the rape charge, was behind Sunday afternoon’s crash.
A cousin in Unnao said that “everyone in the village knew” the woman and her lawyer would be travelling that day to Rae Bareli prison to visit her uncle, who was jailed shortly after the rape allegations came to light and convicted of an unrelated attempted murder charge.
“MLA Kuldeep Singh and his associates planned the attack to threaten us so that we stop pursuing the case,” the cousin said.
Officially, local police are treating the crash as an accident. OP Singh, director general of police in the state, said a “fair and free probe” would be conducted but that “primary probe suggests it was purely an accident due to an over-speeding truck”. The driver and truck owner had been arrested and were being questioned, he said.
Singh said police would “hand over the case to CBI” (India’s Central Bureau of Investigations) if the family demanded.
It would not be the first time the body, India’s equivalent of the US’s FBI, has had to step in in the Unnao case.
After a public uproar, the CBI was ordered to carry out an extensive investigation and filed three charge sheets last year; against Mr Sengar for the alleged rape, Mr Sengar’s brother and associates for the alleged murder of the woman’s father, and Mr Sengar and others for framing the father on trumped-up charges.
“I have told the CBI that I don’t feel safe. I fear for my life – being abducted or killed,” she said.
Priyanka Gandhi, general secretary of the main opposition Congress party, said Sunday’s crash was “shocking” and that serious questions remained about the case, including why the BJP had failed to expel or even suspend Mr Sengar. “Without answers to these questions, can we expect justice from the BJP government?” she asked.
Arvind Kejriwal, leader of the AAP party, wrote on Twitter: “Systematic attempts to eliminate the Unnao rape victim and her family appear to be a pre-planned conspiracy and a mockery of rule of law. How can any civilised society allow such state sponsored barbarism?”
Mr Sengar, who denies all the allegations against him, continued to appear on party banners and paraphernalia in the campaign leading up to May’s general election, which the BJP won by a landslide. Mr Adityanath shared a stage with Mr Sengar’s wife during an election rally in Unnao in April, according to reports. A spokesperson for the BJP was not immediately available to comment.
