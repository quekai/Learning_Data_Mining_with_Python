Barrack has been investigated for potentially violating the law requiring people who try to influence American policy or opinion at the direction of foreign governments or entities to disclose their activities to the Justice Department, people familiar with the case told the Times.
He was reportedly interviewed last month by prosecutors in the public integrity unit of the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn.
Barrack’s spokesman, Owen Blicksilver, told the Times that Barrack's lawyer contacted the prosecutors’ office again and “confirmed they have no further questions for Mr. Barrack.”
Among the interactions reportedly investigated include Barrack coordinating the language in a draft of a speech on energy given by Trump with contacts including Rashid al-Malik, an Emirati businessman who is close to the rulers of the United Arab Emirates.
Barrack's aides told the Times that he acted as an independent intermediary between Persian Gulf leaders and the Trump campaign and administration, never on behalf of any foreign official or entity.
