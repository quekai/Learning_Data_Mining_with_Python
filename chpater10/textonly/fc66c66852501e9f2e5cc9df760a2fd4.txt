“I think from a Brexit negotiating perspective, it was a very bad day yesterday. We will have to wait whether that message coming from London changes in the weeks ahead,” said Coveney.
Johnson’s spokesman, meanwhile, has said the UK is ready to begin talks with the EU on Brexit, but is clear-eyed about what the basis for those discussions is.
The Belfast meeting with Smith, the former chief whip, was the first British-Irish engagement since Boris Johnson became prime minister.
The Irish border backstop is a central part of the withdrawal agreement and commits both sides to maintaining an invisible border on the island of Ireland should trade talks collapse. Johnson has said there were ways to achieve this other than by keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the republic and EU’s regulations on customs and trading standards until a solution was found.
However, Ireland is also concerned about intangibles such as peace and community relations on the border.
Coveney said there was a renewed sense of urgency about getting Stormont back up and running given the challenges the region faces in the coming months.
He said there was hope that a deal could be concluded in the coming weeks to restore power two-and-a-half years after the Stormont assembly collapsed.
The party’s leader, Arlene Foster, has said she is keen to get the local institutions up and running again to get money and reforms flowing again on health and education.
Some supporters had hoped PM would tour capitals explaining alternatives to Brexit withdrawal agreement
