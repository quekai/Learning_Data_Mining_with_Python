Shadow immigration minister Afzal Khan in 2015 shared a clip that denounced ‘Israel-British-Swiss-Rothschilds crime syndicate,’ says he is ‘mortified’ and ‘didn’t read the text’
A prominent member of Britain’s Labour party has apologized for spreading anti-Semitism online, four years after posting a video on Facebook that decried a purported “Israel-British-Swiss-Rothschilds crime syndicate.”

In 2008 Khan received a high national honor, the CBE, for his community and interfaith work, and is co-founder of the Muslim Jewish Forum of Greater Manchester.
							
“I am mortified and sincerely sorry about this genuine accident,” Khan told the British broadcaster. “I didn’t read the text below, which contained an anti-Semitic conspiracy about the Rothschilds. I would never have shared it if I had seen that.”

Labour has grappled with anti-Semitism in its ranks since the far-left Corbyn was elected party chief in 2015, with fresh scrutiny coming after a number of former party officials accused him and his allies of interfering in efforts to address the issue, in a BBC program aired earlier this month.
One former Labour official interviewed by the BBC accused Corbyn of having âdone more than anyone in modern political history to bring about the rise of anti-Semitismâ and described how interference with his efforts to deal with the problem almost drove him to suicide.
The party has been subject to an ongoing investigation by the UKâs Equality and Human Rights Commission, a government watchdog that is looking into thousands of cases of anti-Semitic hate speech in the partyâs ranks since 2015.
