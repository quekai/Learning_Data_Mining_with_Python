Indian authorities have rescued 1,050 people from a train after it became trapped by flooding near Mumbai.
Helicopters, boats and diving teams were deployed by the Indian authorities after the Mahalaxmi Express was stranded on Friday night close to the town of Vangani.
Passengers told news agency IANS they were ordered to stay onboard but had had no food or water for 15 hours.

                    Nine pregnant women are reportedly among those who have been rescued
                
Train operator Central Railway said all passengers - including nine pregnant women - had been recovered and taken to safety.
A spokesperson for the train operator also said alternative travel arrangements had been arranged for passengers affected.
Most areas in the nearby towns of Badlapur, Ulhasnagar, Vangani have been submerged as heavy rains battered the region this week, swelling local rivers. 
Other transport has also been hit by flooding in Mumbai, with 11 flights cancelled and several others diverted by from the city's airport.
