 Beijing on Monday responded to political unrest that has rocked Hong Kong for nearly two months, saying Hong Kong's society would "suffer" if the protests continue. 
 The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, the Chinese government agency responsible for coordination between the mainland and the two territories, on Monday held the first press conference of its 22-year history. 
 The agency expressed support for Carrie Lam, the embattled Hong Kong chief executive who is facing calls to resign, and for the Hong Kong Police Force, which has been accused of using unnecessary force against protesters. 
 "Hong Kong cannot afford to have instability," the statement said. "Should the chaos continue, it is the entire Hong Kong that will suffer."
