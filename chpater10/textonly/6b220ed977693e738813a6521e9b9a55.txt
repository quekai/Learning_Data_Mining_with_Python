Former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce has tried to walk back comments he made to a newspaper in which he claimed his $211,000 income was "spread thin".
The article prompted criticism from his fellow parliamentarians, prompting Mr Joyce to clarify his circumstances.
"You've all read it but I am not skint â€¦ I am on an incredibly good wage and even on that there come times where you've really got to budget because of circumstances that I brought on myself," he said.
Mr Joyce supports two families, having separated from his wife, Natalie, the mother of four of his children.
In the article, Mr Joyce said he eats his own sheep, rarely eats out and switches off the heater on cold winter nights.
Mr Joyce said he had called for an increase to Newstart because he had a new understanding for how tough it would be to live on.
"It's not that I'm not getting money, it's just that it's spread so thin," he told News Corp's The Courier-Mail.
"What a ridiculous, stupid way to explain himself and he is saying Newstart allowance, people need a helping hand, which I've been saying for some time now."
About 723,000 Australians receive the Newstart allowance. If they are single they live on about $40 a day.
Welfare groups, the business community and politicians across the political spectrum have called for an increase in Newstart payments.
The Government has repeatedly rejected those calls and insisted two-thirds of people on Newstart found work within 12 months.
