BREAKING: Initial reports of alleged Israeli airstrikes taking place at an underground weapon warehouse at the Ashraf base near al-Azim area in northern Diyala, Iraq.
Reports suggest that at least 40 Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah terrorists were eliminated in the strikes.
According to Iraqi sources, a consignment of ballistic missile launchers transferred a short time ago from Iran to Iraq was targeted in the strikes.  Additional strikes were reported in another two locations.
Residents in Lebanon report several jets circling at multiple altitudes near Beirut and Tyre. In northern Israel, residents have been reporting intense IAF activity as well as multiple explosions, (likely sonic booms) over the last few hours.
Citing Iranian, Iraqi and Western sources, Reuters reported last year that Iran had transferred short-range ballistic missiles to Shi’ite allies in Iraq. Baghdad denied the findings.
The following week, Israel said it might attack such sites in Iraq, effectively expanding a campaign now focused in Syria.
Israel has carried out scores of airstrikes in Syria against military deployments and arms deliveries
