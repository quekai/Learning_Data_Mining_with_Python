Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Wanda Vasquez, who was set to succeed embattled Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello at the end of the week, said Sunday she does not want the job.
“I reiterate, I have no interest in occupying the position of Governor,” Vasquez tweeted. “I hope that the Governor identifies and submits a candidate for the position of Secretary of State before August 2 and I have told him so.”
Me reitero, no tengo interés en ocupar el puesto de Gobernadora. Es un dictamen Constitucional. Espero que el señor Gobernador identifique y someta un candidato para el puesto de Secretario/a de Estado antes del 2 de agosto y así se lo he manifestado.
The millions of protesters who have filled the streets in recent weeks calling for Rossello’s ouster have also called for Vasquez to step down, with #WandaRenuncia trending on Twitter along with #RickyRenuncia, the hashtag used by activists urging Rossello’s resignation. Rossello announced last week that he will depart office on Aug. 2.
