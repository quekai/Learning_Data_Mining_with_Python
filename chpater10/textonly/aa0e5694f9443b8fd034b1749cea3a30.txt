China's top Hong Kong policy office will on Monday address the escalating protests in the semi-autonomous city over the past eight weekends. 
Beijing's office dealing with Hong Kong and Macau affairs will give its first briefing on the issue from the Chinese capital at 3 p.m. local time Monday.
On Sunday, protesters defied police orders to march through the center of the city, with groups splintering in different directions and blocking major roads. Many wore black, the adopted color of the protest movement, and carried signs condemning alleged police brutality. 
Riot police confronted hundreds of mainly young protesters who tried to reach the Chinese government's Liaison Office. During demonstrations last weekend, activists vandalized the building and flung paint at the national emblem, drawing a furious reaction from Beijing.
