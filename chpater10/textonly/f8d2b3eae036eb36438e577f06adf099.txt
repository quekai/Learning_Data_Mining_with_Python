Unisys BrandVoice: Blueprint for 10 Billion: How Businesses Can Transform to Thrive In A More Populous World
		
The Dublin-based company saw its profit after tax drop by 21% to €243 million ($270 million; £219 million), blaming a fierce price competition and higher fuel and staff costs.
Compared to June of last year, Ryanair’s revenues rose by 11% to €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion; £2.1 billion) but the company’s better performance has been curtailed, among others, by falling ticket prices due to downward pressures in markets such as Germany and lower consumer confidence caused by uncertainty over Brexit in the U.K.
Furthermore, Ryanair’s dependence on Boeing has made it vulnerable in light of the precautionary measures and the necessary grounding of its 737 Max jet family.
Consequently, delays to the delivery of the newly purchased 737 Max jet planes could in the future cause planning difficulties to the company as it will be under increased pressure to meet the growing demand in a highly competitive environment.
Earlier in July the company also lost one of its key executives to its biggest competitor, easyJet. Peter Bellew who has worked for Ryanair as its chief operations officer and who has been highly regarded by the management will be a loss for the company. He helped turn the airliner around after it had to cancel thousands of flights in the winter of 2017-2018 due to pilot shortages.
Nevertheless, despite these pressures, Ryanair maintains its prediction for its annual profits, expected to reach between €750 to €950 million ($833 million to $1 billion; £675 to £850 million), which would be broadly flat compared to its last year’s results.
