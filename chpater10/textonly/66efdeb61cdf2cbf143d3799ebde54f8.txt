Almost three-quarters of Britons would support a nationwide deposit return system for plastic and glass drinks bottles and aluminium cans, a survey has found.
The all-in model would see a small charge added to the cost of drinks containers made from glass, PET plastic, aluminium and steel. When the empty container is returned to a collection point to be recycled, the charge would be refunded.
A third of people surveyed by YouGov for the Campaign to Protect Rural England believe that the UK-wide system should be just as comprehensive as Scottish system. The survey also found that 39% of people believe the UK-wide system should include more materials, such as drinks cartons and pouches.
Maddy Haughton-Boakes, litter campaigner for CPRE, said: “With Michael Gove having thrown his weight behind a truly ‘all-in’ deposit return system, and with the Scottish government’s decision to introduce one earlier this year, this latest wave of public support is surely all the evidence needed for the government to get this over the line.”
Haughton-Boakes said: “It’s absolutely fantastic that so many people have shown such high levels of support for the scheme before its even been introduced.
“A deposit return system will transform the way we deal with waste, boost recycling and as a result, finally put a stop to the harm that drinks containers are causing our countryside, environment and wildlife.”
