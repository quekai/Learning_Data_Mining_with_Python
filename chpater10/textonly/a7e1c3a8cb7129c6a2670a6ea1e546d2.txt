A video of a police singing and playing guitar with protesters at Ihumātao has taken off on social media.
 It has been viewed over 80,000 times in just eight hours, with viewers praising the officer for joining the crowd.
A video of a police officer singing with people at Ihumātao has been described as a "beautiful moment".
 "Cops are not all that bad. He's there to do mahi to feed his whanau ... we are all one," one person commented.
 "I have never ever wanted to hug a police fella, never ever ... Till now. Be blessed whanau katoa," another person wrote.
 "His job is as a cop but, he's Māori first. This alone proves we are a unique country. PROUD," another Facebook user added.
 Police have been monitoring the protest since it began last week, when an eviction notice was issued to those illegally occupying the land.
 Fletcher Building wants to construct a state housing development on the site but protesters believe the sacred land, considered to be one of the earliest sites where Māori arrived in New Zealand, should be left in its natural state.
 On Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a halt to building work at Ihumātao until the dispute was resolved.
