The P&O cruise ship Britannia was on the final leg of a cruise to Norway's fjords from Southampton, in southeast England, when the fracas broke out, ITV reported.  
"One witness, part of a group involved in the trouble, explained to staff that things kicked off when another passenger appeared dressed as a clown," Gaisford said. 
"This upset one of their party because they'd specifically booked a cruise with no fancy dress. It led to a violent confrontation."
"There was blood everywhere," Gaisford wrote. "Passengers used furniture and plates as weapons. Witnesses told me they were so frightened they had to hide as family groups fought," Gaisford added. 
Police told ITV that three men and three women were assaulted during the fight and that there were a number of injuries including cuts and bruises. 
Those believed to have been involved in the fight were confined to their cabin for the last day of the cruise, ITV reported.
Hampshire Police told CNN on Sunday that a man and woman arrested on suspicion of assault in connection to the brawl have not been charged and were released from custody -- but remain under investigation.
In a statement, a P&O Cruises spokesman told CNN on Sunday: "Following an incident on board Britannia on Thursday evening we can confirm that all guests disembarked yesterday and the matter is now in the hands of the local police."
