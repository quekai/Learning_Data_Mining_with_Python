The oil spill occurred on Saturday off Guarello Island on the Chilean side of Patagonia, the pristine southernmost region making up the tip of both Argentina and Chile. 
The navy said several units were deployed to the area to control the spill, which had entered the waters of the South Pacific. It reported that by Sunday approximately 15,000 liters of contaminated seawater were contained. A barge and an ocean patrol boat were dispatched to the site as part of the recovery process.
The cause of the spill was not immediately clear, and the Chilean Navy has launched an investigation.
He urged the government to make all resources available and called on CAP to hand over as much information as possible on the spill.
CAP said it would collaborate in the probe. In a statement reported by Reuters, it said it had initiated "a process of permanent monitoring in the area", in addition to its standard control and mitigation measures. 
Guarello Island, in the Magallanes region, has large reserves of limestone and is used by CAP as a mining base. The surrounding areas of Patagonia are home to a diverse range of ecosystems with rare flora as well as endangered species.
