The prime minister says the Office for Veterans' Affairs will handle the "full gamut of veterans' civilian lives".
A new Office for Veterans' Affairs will be set up to provide greater lifelong support for military personnel, Downing Street has said.
The office will coordinate Whitehall departments in addressing the issues facing former armed services personnel.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would handle the "full gamut of veterans' civilian lives" including "ensuring they get the medical treatment they require, to further training and skills after they have transitioned from service to keep them in good jobs, to targeted interventions to prevent the scourge of veteran homelessness".
He added: "It is absolutely right that the government should do all it can to support our armed forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.
"They have so much to offer our workplaces and wider society and it would be a dereliction of duty not to harness that potential."
Oliver Dowden, the paymaster general and Cabinet Office minister, will represent the office at cabinet.
He will work closely with former soldier Johnny Mercer, who becomes minister for defence people and veterans.
"It's taken four years but we finally now have an Office for Veterans' Affairs in the UK," Mr Mercer said.
"Our people are indeed our finest asset, and I look forward to my role as the government minister for defence people and veterans."
The newly created Office for Veterans' Affairs will be staffed by officials from the Cabinet Office and Ministry of Defence.
