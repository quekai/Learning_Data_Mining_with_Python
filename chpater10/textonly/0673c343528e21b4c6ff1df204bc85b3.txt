The prominent Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny and his wife, Yulia. He was arrested last week for planning Saturday’s protest in Moscow.
MOSCOW â A day after an unauthorized election protest he planned drew mass arrests in Moscow, Aleksei A. Navalny, Russiaâs most prominent opposition leader, was hospitalized with a âsevere allergic reactionâ in jail, his spokeswoman said on Sunday.
Mr. Navalny was arrested on Wednesday and sentenced to 30 days in jail for calling a rally on Saturday to protest a decision by the election authorities to bar several opposition candidates from running for Moscowâs City Council.
Ms. Yarmysh wrote that employees at the special detention center in Russia where Mr. Navalny was being held had called an ambulance, and that he had been taken to a hospital where police officers were guarding his room.
Though the reason for his hospitalization was unclear, Mr. Navalny is no stranger to having his health imperiled because of his activism.
On Sunday evening, Mr. Navalnyâs regular physician, Anastasy Vasilyeva, visited him in the hospital with another doctor, Yaroslav Ashikhmin, and said she saw similarities to that incident.
âAleksei doesnât have any allergy and has never had one. Moreover, he ate the same food with his cellmates and didnât use any new perfumes or personal care products,â she said, adding that while in the hospital, Mr. Navalny can only eat the food that is allowed in prison.
âAlmost immediately we were told to leave,â she wrote. Following deliberations with the hospitalâs head doctor, Ms. Vasilyeva said that she and Mr. Ashikhmin were able to examine Mr. Navalny âthrough a door.â
âImmediately upon release, I got all swollen and covered with red spots,â Mr. Volkov wrote. âWe thought this was an allergy.â
Late Sunday night, the Moscow police arrested over a dozen people who came to stand in front of the hospital, according to OVD-Info, an independent monitor that tracks arrests around the city.
