Hundreds laid flowers and prayed during the wake for Carabinieri police officer Mario Cerciello Rega. 
The 35-year-old will be laid to rest Monday in his hometown of Somma Vesuviana, near Naples. His funeral will be held in the same church where he got married less than two months ago. Rega had just returned to work on the police force following his honeymoon.
Rega's wake comes as police say they they are investigating a photo that appears to show one of the American suspects blindfolded at a police station in Rome.
