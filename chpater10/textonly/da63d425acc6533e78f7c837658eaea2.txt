Research Shows Earth Warming Faster Than Any Other Time in Last 2,000 Years, Debunks Theory Cited by Climate Skeptics
New satellite data shows the rate of deforestation is increasing in the Amazon, prompting fears the rainforest could reach a tipping point beyond which it could not recover.
The deforestation of Brazil's Amazon rainforest is happening so rapidly that a point of no return is fast approaching, recent studies have revealed.
The Detecção de Desmatamento em Tempo Real (Real-Time Deforestation Detection) satellite system began monitoring deforestation in 2015. According to the data, deforestation this month is on course to raze a swath of forest the size of Greater London – about 605 square miles.

The rainforest plays a vital role in stabilizing the global climate by acting as a "carbon sink," meaning it absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Without the forest, the land could be transformed into a savanna, which would greatly diminish the check on carbon dioxide.
"It’s very important to keep repeating these concerns. There are a number of tipping points which are not far away," Philip Fearnside, a professor at Brazil’s National Institute of Amazonian Research, told the Guardian. "We can’t see exactly where they are, but we know they are very close. It means we have to do things right away. Unfortunately that is not what is happening. There are people denying we even have a problem."
Some of the blame for the accelerated deforestation lies with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who was voted into office seven months ago and has called for the development of the Amazon region, a policy that encourages illegal logging practices and burning.
"Unfortunately, it is absurd, but it should not catch anyone by surprise," Carlos Rittl, executive secretary of Brazilian non-profit The Climate Observatory, told the Guardian. "President Jair Bolsonaro and minister Ricardo Salles (Minister of the Environment) are dismantling our socio-environmental policies."
The Bolsonaro administration has also taken heat for criticizing IBAMA, a government ministry that advocates for the preservation of the rainforest, for handing out fines to illegal loggers and others who clear the forest.
