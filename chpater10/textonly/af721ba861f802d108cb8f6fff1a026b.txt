Atheist parents take primary school to court as they say assembly prayersÂ  breach childrenâs human rights

Â Lee Harris and his wife Lizanne have won permission to bring a judicial review against Oxford Diocesan Schools TrustÂ 
Lee Harris and his wife Lizanne have won permission to bring a judicial review against Oxford Diocesan Schools Trust (ODST) after arguing that Burford Primary School is acting âunlawfullyâ.
They allege that since ODST took over the running of the community school in 2015, they noticed âharmful aspects of evangelism spreading into assemblyâ and other parts of their pupils' education.Â 
ODST is a multi-academy trust that runs 33 schools, all of which are Church of England bar four, including Â Burford Primary, which are designated as non-religious âcommunity schoolsâ. Â 
The trustÂ says on its website that it âoperates within the family of the Diocese of Oxfordâ adding: âWe are motivated by our Christian values to serve our local communities, but we do not impose those valuesâ.
Humanists UK, which is supporting Mr and Mrs Harris, believe this will be a test case to challenge schools which hold a daily act of Christian worship without providing a suitable alternative for non-Christians.
They add that once a week there is a longer assembly which involves an external Christian group âdressing as biblical charactersâ and acting out Christian stories including the crucifixion.
Parents are arguing that this interferes with their children's right to receive an education âfree from religious interferenceâ
By failing to provide an alternative that is of âequal educational worthâ, the school has breached it public sector equality duty to have âdue regardâ to peopleâs beliefs and has also breached the childrenâs human right by denying them education.
The school also holds various functions in a Church, including a harvest event and the Year Six leavers event, where every pupil is given a bible.
Mr and Mrs Harris say that they do not want their children to attend these events, which leaves them âdeprived of the benefit of what should be important elements of school and community lifeâ. This amounts to another breach of equalities laws since their children are effectively being discriminated against, they argue.
Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK, said: "We are the only sovereign state in the world to require schools to hold daily Christian worship, yet 80 per cent of our young people and 75 per cent of people of parental age are not Christians.â
Anne Davey, chief executive of ODST, said it is ânot appropriateâ to comment on legal proceedings while the case is ongoing. Â 
âODST is confident that Burford Primary School has acted entirely appropriately, and has followed statute in ways that are similar to all local or indeed national schools,â she said. Â 
âIt has provided exactly what the law requires, which includes provision for children to be withdrawn if parents so request.â Â 
Burford Primaryh was judged to be âGoodâ in its most recent Ofsted report. InspectorsÂ Â said that pupils âspeak with confidence about different faiths and culturesâ, and added that pupils âhave a keen sense of equalities and their work demonstrates a deep understanding of British Valuesâ.
