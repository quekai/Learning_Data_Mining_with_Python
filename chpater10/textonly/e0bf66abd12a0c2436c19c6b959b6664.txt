                    The radical EFF opposition party has made land expropriation without compensation a key national issue
                
A presidential panel in South Africa has proposed expropriation of land without compensation, but in limited circumstances. 
White people, who make up just 9% of the population, own 72% of the farmland that is held by individuals. 
The governing African National Congress (ANC) has repeatedly pledged to accelerate land transfers to the black majority since taking office in 1994, after white-minority rule ended, but progress has been slow. 
Those opposed to land expropriation point to Zimbabwe where a similar policy by former President Robert Mugabe wrecked the economy and scared away investors. 
President Ramaphosa set up the team of experts last year as the ANC was coming under pressure from opposition parties, especially from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). 
It said those who had bought property since the end of apartheid should be treated differently to those who had inherited land that was held under the apartheid system.
The main opposition Democratic Alliance party rejected the report's recommendations, saying land expropriation without compensation would "further batter our ailing economy".
The Natives Land Act of 1913 restricted black people from buying or renting land in "white South Africa", leading to the forced removals of black people
After the end of apartheid in 1994, the ANC government said it wanted to return 30% of this land to its previous owners by 2014
