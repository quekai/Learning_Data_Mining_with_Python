An asteroid hit Mars billions of years ago, forming Lomonosov Crater. It also may have a 1,000-foot-high tsunami that swept across the young Red Planet.
The standard timeline is that Mars lost its water-world status closer to 3.7 billion years ago, not long after its core cooled and then solidified and its magnetic field disappeared. That in turn allowed solar particles to strike Mars’ atmosphere and strip away the protective gasses. Without an atmosphere, Mars couldn’t retain surface water, which should have disappeared in relatively short order.
