former governor of the Colombian department of ChocÃ³ and former Colombian minister of environment and sustainable development.
For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we’re joined by Luis Gilberto Murillo. He served as governor of the predominantly Afro-Colombian department of ChocÃ³. And in 2012âMurillo was the minister of environment and sustainable development in Colombia from 2016 to 2018, under the previous president. He’s currently a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University and was one of those who was protesting outside the Colombian ambassador to the United States’s home in Washington, D.C.
Luis Gilberto Murillo, thank you so much for joining us. Can you explain why you were out in the streets Friday, and so many were out in your country of Colombia, protesting the deaths of more than 400 activists in Colombia over the last few years?
Obviously, all Colombians went to the streets, a majority of them last July 26, including here in Washington, where, under the leadership of the Colombian Human Rights Committee here in Washington, we went to express our really sorry atâbecause of this tragedy of the killings of social leaders in Colombia. This is something that needs to move not only Colombia, but the entire international community.
Most of the leaders that have been killed are social leaders, environmental leaders, community leaders, rural leaders that are really fighting for their rights. And what happened to MarÃ­a del Pilar Hurtado really moved the country. And we all went to the streets to really say that we are supporting these leaders, we are in solidarity with social leaders, and against the assassinations, and also calling for the consciousness of Colombian society and the international community.
And we really express our intention to break with the indolence and violence that have been really affecting all these communities in the area that have been neglected for a long time, and communities that really want to be included, our communities that are fighting for peace, because those are communities that need basic services from the stateâeducation, health, justiceâto have the opportunity to access to the decent job. And this is why many communities, like rural, Afro-Colombians, indigenous, are really demanding the government to implement the peace agreement, because this is the opportunity for these communities to be integrated in a dignified way to the Colombian society.
And something that is happening is that the political climate that is being created in Colombia because of the critics of the peace agreement is that those who are connected to illegal groups feel very empowered to attack social leaders and to avoid the implementation of the peace process. This is why we are demanding full implementation of the peace process and, in addition to that, also to end the killings of social leaders, if not to decrease the numbers of killings, because each life, every life is precious. And also, the way to avoid these killings to happen is the full implementation of the peace process, because the peace process has some provisions to protect social leaders. For example, there is a national commission to guarantee the protection of social leaders in the country. And that commission has been not convened regularly by the current government.
For example, there’s an intention of the current government to go back to use aerial spraying, aerial fumigation with glyphosate, with Roundup, to eradicate coca in many areas. This aerial fumigation is already banned by Constitutional Court. And the Constitutional Court reaffirmed that ban recently in a ruling that they had two weeks ago.
And what we are saying is that aerial fumigation is an approach that has to be banned from Colombia because of the impact on health, on environment. And we are talking about aerial spraying with Roundup in areas of the Amazon Basin. We are talking about this aerial spraying affecting communities in those areas, Afro-Colombians, indigenous communities, rural communities in general.
And it’s not effective. It’s not effective, because in 2006 and 2007, when the fumigation was widespread, Colombia fumigated areas of the size of Rhode Island, the state of Rhode Island in the United States, and coca, instead of decreasing, coca cultivation increased. And also to eradicate one area of coca, you need to fumigate around 25 hectares of coca. So, it’s not really effective. This is very costly. So we think that in that regard, the inclination of the United States to support aerial spraying and aerial fumigation with Roundup is wrong.
In terms of Colombia, obviously deforestation is a huge challengeâand not only for Colombia, for Peru and for Brazil. Colombia was able, because of the measures that were taken by the government to decrease deforestation in 10% last year.
However, in Brazil, the policy is very different. Bolsonaro is a denier of climate change, and members of his Cabinet. And they are promoting a policy to increase the exploitation, increase the timber and logging in the Amazon Basin. And that’s creating, obviously, a climate for increasing dramatically deforestation in the Amazon. And this is very irresponsible for the entire region.
And also, in addition to that, what we see is that he is obviously weakening the implementation of measures to protect the rights of ethnic minorities, of indigenous communities, of Afro-descendant communities in their quilombolas, that are key to protect that vital ecosystem for the entire world.
And I think that, in terms of the United States, we are inviting the United States and other countries to define a framework to really protect the Amazonian Basin, because of their importance. I think that the United States needs to give more priority to the protection of forests in the entire world, and particularly in the Amazon Basin.
