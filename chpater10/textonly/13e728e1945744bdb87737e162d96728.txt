			"The results of the just declared tiger census would make every Indian happy," Narendra Modi said, adding that the number of tigers in India today stands at around 3,000. 		
“The story which started from ‘Ek Tha Tiger’ and reached to ‘Tiger Zinda hai’, shouldn’t end there,” PM Modi said, adding that the results of the just declared tiger census would make every Indian happy. “Nine years ago, it was decided in St. Petersburg that target of doubling tiger population will be 2022. We completed this target 4 years early,” he said.
Adding that India will strike a balance between development and environment, PM Modi said, “India will build more homes for our citizens and at the same time create quality habitats for animals. India will have a vibrant marine economy and healthier marine ecology. This balance is what will contribute to a strong and inclusive India,” Narendra Modi said.
In 2014, the country had registered the presence of 2,226 tigers. Wildlife Institute of India authored the report jointly with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and state Forest Departments.
About the safety of these tigers found in new human-dominated landscapes, Mathur said, “the beauty of the Wildlife Protection Act is that it offers protection to wildlife wherever it is found. So, it should help.”
