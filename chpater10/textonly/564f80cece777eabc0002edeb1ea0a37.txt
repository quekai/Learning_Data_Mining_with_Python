Presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders is heading to Canada on Sunday with a caravan of Type 1 diabetes patients seeking cheaper insulin to highlight the "corruption" of pharmaceutical companies and the toll taken on Americans who can't afford the medicine.
I just boarded the bus in Detroit with diabetics, on our way to Windsor, Canada, to buy affordable insulin. Americans are paying $300 for insulin. In Canada they can purchase it for $30. We are going to end pharma’s greed.
"People are dying," Sanders earlier told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union," in an interview hosted from Detroit, Michigan.  He said the cost of insulin in the US has "soared in recent years" and "there is strong evidence that there is price fixing, that these companies simultaneously raise the prices at outrageous levels far, far, far more than the cost of production."
He accused drug company executives of "corruption" and "unbelievable greed." In Canada, he said, insulin is "one-tenth of the price."
"One out of four people are rationing their insulin, and people are dying. That is unacceptable in the United States of America," he claims.
Sanders said if elected president, "we're going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, we're going to have an attorney general who is going to deal with the incredible concentration of ownership and we're going to use anti-trust legislation."

With our foul racist clown now attacking entire cities/districts of color, behold the glory of people fighting back. After Trump bizarrely trashed Elijah Cummings as a "bully" and "racist" whose district is a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess" where "no human being would want to live," Baltimore and environs had at him. Best was a fiery editorial slamming the inept son of a Klansman. Its final sick burn: " Better to (have) vermin living in your neighborhood than to be one."
