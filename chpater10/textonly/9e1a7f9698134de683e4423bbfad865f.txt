âEurope can ignore or deny or struggle against its own identity and its Christian roots. But by doing so the society commits suicide,â said LÃ¡szlÃ³ Kiss-RigÃ³, the bishop of Szeged, as he drove into Budapest on a recent afternoon. âAnd the more migrants that come, the more Christian values will be watered down.â
As well as his role as bishop, he is also the chairman of Szegedâs local football team, which is owned by the church. He was in Budapest to make arrangements for the inaugural concert at a new multipurpose stadium, which will be opened later this summer with an appearance by Placido Domingo â just one part of the massive investment that the football-mad OrbÃ¡n has made into the sport.
On the matter of migration, and much else, Kiss-RigÃ³ and OrbÃ¡n are singing from the same hymn sheet. The bishop denies, for example, that putting up walls to keep people out of the country doesnât fit with Christian values. âEveryone who knocks at your door and asks admission is welcome to be examined. But people who jump into your house through the roof should be protected against,â he said.
The populist right is forging an unholy alliance with religion | Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins and Anton JÃ¤ger
For many liberals, and increasingly for some of his supposed allies in the EPP, he signifies all that is rotten, corrupt and downright scary in contemporary politics on the continent.
One thing OrbÃ¡nâs admirers and detractors agree on is that he has become symbolic of something bigger than the fate of a smallish central European state with a population of fewer than 10 million. The man himself clearly relishes his increasingly large role in European political discourse.
Frustrated with Brussels and other European critics, OrbÃ¡n has built alliances with neighbouring countries, notably throughout the V4, which comprises Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all of whose leaders have at times expressed varying degrees of unhappiness with the EU, and whose unity in messaging is growing.
The Hungarian Catholic church, the largest church in the country, has been supportive of OrbÃ¡nâs hardline policies on migration, despite frequent calls from the pope for Europe to be more tolerant and understanding of the suffering of those who have fled war and poverty.
Only 15% of Hungarians say they attend church on a weekly basis, but 80% identify as Christian. OrbÃ¡n, who started out in politics in the late 1980s as an anti-communist activist with little time for religion, found God in the 1990s, and even remarried his wife in a religious ceremony.
Kiss-RigÃ³, who believes that most migrants at the Hungarian border are wealthier than the police repelling them, and that âonly a tiny minorityâ are actually refugees, sidestepped questions on whether he agreed with the popeâs calls for tolerance.
âIâm not saying all of this because I hope that next Sunday more people will come to church. In Europe, even an atheist is a Christian,â he said.
Hungaryâs foreign policy has also been taking on an increasingly Christian hue. A special âHungary Helpsâ programme has been set up to provide aid to persecuted Christians in Africa and the Middle East. âHelp should be provided where the trouble lies instead of bringing the trouble to Europe,â said a spokesman for the programme. He said it had disbursed $30m in aid in the past two years, almost exclusively to help Christian communities or projects backed by Christian groups.
As Budapest has come in for increasing criticism from Brussels over rule-of-law concerns and democratic backsliding, OrbÃ¡n has wooed other far-right leaders who use Christian rhetoric. He was the only EU leader to attend the inauguration of Brazilâs president Jair Bolsonaro in January, while he enjoys a warm relationship with the Law and Justice government in Poland.
Katalin NovÃ¡k, Hungaryâs minister of state for family, youth and international affairs, has also had a busy travel schedule, meeting rightwing and Christian groups in many countries to showcase the governmentâs policies on improving birth rates and promoting traditional values. In March, she gave the keynote address at a conference organised by the Hungarian embassy in Washington entitled âMaking Families Great Againâ, attended by a number of rightwing American Christian groups.
âWe think that the problems of Europe can be traced back to the denial of Christian roots. We see the misinterpretation of tolerance many times. Being tolerant should not mean that one gives up his or her identity,â said NovÃ¡k, in written responses to questions.
These talking points have hit home with some rightwing Republicans, improving the standing of OrbÃ¡n in Washington, and meaning some officials ended up more suspicious of NGOs and opposition activists than of OrbÃ¡nâs government. âWrapping itself in the words of being a Christian nation, with traditional values, created a subtext that critics are not legitimately concerned about the deterioration of the rule of law, but instead motivated by a progressive and pro-LGBT agenda,â said Scott Cullinane, who until last year was professional staff member on a congressional subcommittee dealing with Hungary.
OrbÃ¡nâs position in Europe looks to be weakened after the recent European elections and a series of scandals among potential far-right allies, which means the approval of Trump and rightwing republicans is a useful blessing.
âWe are very happy that there are a few politicians like OrbÃ¡n and Trump who really represent those values which we Christians believe to be important,â said Kiss-RigÃ³, when asked if it was plausible to hold up the US president as a paragon of Christian virtue. For him, as for OrbÃ¡n, the backlash against liberalism is more important than any specific Christian virtues.
âI donât think he will be canonised in the Catholic church but this is not the point. After the attempted dictatorship of nihilism, manipulated by the PC-talkers, his personality is a refreshing one.â
