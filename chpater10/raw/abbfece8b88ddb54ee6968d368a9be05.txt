suspected Boko Haram extremists have killed more than 60 people during an attack on villagers who were leaving a funeral.</p>  <p>It is the deadliest extremist attack on civilians in the region so far this year.</p>  <p>Muhammad Bulama, council chairman of the Nganzai local government area, told reporters that 11 other people were wounded during the midday attack on Saturday.</p>  <p>Bulama called it a reprisal after villagers fought off a Boko Haram attack in the area two weeks ago.</p>  <p>Nigerians last week marked the grim 10-year anniversary of the Boko Haram insurgency, which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and created one of the world&#x27;s largest humanitarian crises.</p>  <p>The militants, who seek to impose a strict Islamic state in the region, have defied the claims of President Muhammadu Buhari&#x27;s administration over the years that the insurgency has been crushed. The violence also has spilled into neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon.</p>  <div><span><figure class="imageMedia image full"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholderImage" style="padding-bottom:85.48%"></div><img alt="" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5228446.1564360475!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/nigeria-boko-haram-borno.jpg"/></div></figure></span></div>  <p>Nigeria&#x27;s military did not immediately comment on Saturday&#x27;s attack.</p>  <p>Bunu Bukar, secretary of the Borno Hunters Association, a self-defence group, said the militants roared up on motorbikes Saturday and opened fire on villagers returning from offering funeral prayers for a relative. He said his colleagues had recovered nearly two dozen bodies.</p>  <p>Bana Musa, who also serves on the local council, told The Associated Press that some people managed to escape the gunfire.</p></span></div></div><div class="contentFeedback"><div class="bottomSeparator"><a href="https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/vision/governance/journalistic-standards-and-practices" class="journalistLink">CBC&#x27;s Journalistic Standards and Practices</a><span class="separator">|</span><a href="/news/about-cbc-news-1.1294364" class="trustProjectLink">About CBC <!-- -->News</a></div><a href="javascript:location.href=&quot;//www.cbc.ca/news2/feedback/index_typo.html?Extremists blamed for attack on Nigerian village that killed over 60 &quot; + new Date().toString();" class="reportIssue">Report Typo or Error</a><span class="separator">|</span><a href="//cbchelp.cbc.ca/hc/en-us/requests/new" class="feedback">Send Feedback</a></div></div><div class="detailSideBar"><div class="bigbox"><div class="ad-bigbox-fixed responsive ad-detail"></div></div></div></div><div class="belowTheFold"><div class="lazy-load"></div><div class="lazy-load"></div><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"WebPage","speakable":{"@type":"SpeakableSpecification","cssSelector":[".detailHeadline",".detailSummary"]}}</script></div></div></main><footer class="globalFooter sclt-footer" role="contentinfo" aria-label="CBC Footer"><div class="footerBody extendedFooter"><h2 class="a11y">Footer Links</h2><div class="footerColumn connect"><h3 class="footerHeading">Connect with CBC</h3><ul class="footerList"><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cbc/" class="footerLink">Facebook</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://twitter.com/cbc/" class="footerLink">Twitter</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CBCtv" class="footerLink">YouTube</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cbc/?hl=en" class="footerLink">Instagram</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://cbchelp.cbc.ca/hc/en-ca/categories/115000249853-Help-with-CBC-Apps" class="footerLink">Mobile</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/rss/" class="footerLink">RSS</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a class="footerLink" href="/radio/podcasts">Podcasts</a></li><li class="footerItem"><a href="https://subscriptions.cbc.ca/listmanagement/" class="footerLink">Newsletters</a></li></ul></div><div class="footerColumn contact"><h3 class="footerHeading">Contact CBC</h3><p>Audience Relations, CBC <br/>P.O.
