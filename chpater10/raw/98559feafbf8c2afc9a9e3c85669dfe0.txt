Conservative Party members, but it is strongly opposed by pro-EU Britons, including some members of his own party.</p><p>The new prime minister met Monday with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who says she won’t support leaving the EU without an agreement.</p><p>While the U.K. as a whole voted to leave the EU in 2016, Scotland backed remaining by a large margin.</p><p>Johnson was
